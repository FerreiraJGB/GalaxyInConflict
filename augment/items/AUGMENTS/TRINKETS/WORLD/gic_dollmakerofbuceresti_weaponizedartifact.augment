"''The little thing turned out to be a boon. Started acting like a little person. Even did housekeeping in the little train car I called home. It's crazy to think about it even now, but I've never been happier to have someone again. Alarm wakes me up one day, and I see three of the dolls sitting on the table. They did try to get into my pants a few days later...''
