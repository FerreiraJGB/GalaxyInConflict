  "description" : "The reticle of the SUSAT is of unusual design. Unlike the traditional crosshair layouts commonly used, which are in essence a cross intersecting the target, the SUSAT has a single obelisk-shaped post protruding from the bottom edge of the sight. Mounted on a fixed siderail mount, supporting placement on most weapons lacking integrated rails.
