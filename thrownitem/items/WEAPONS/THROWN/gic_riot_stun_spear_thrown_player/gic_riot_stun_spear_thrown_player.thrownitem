  "description" : "A Riot Stun Spear you've prepared to throw. It's tuned to overload upon impact with the ground, releasing chaff-like metallic dust which rapidly electrifies an immediate area.
There was archaeological evidence that javelins and throwing sticks were already in use by the last phase of the Lower Paleolithic. Seven spear-like objects were found on Earth in a coal mine in the former city of Sch√∂ningen, Germany (now an exclusion zone). Stratigraphic dating indicates that the weapons were about 400,000 years old.",
