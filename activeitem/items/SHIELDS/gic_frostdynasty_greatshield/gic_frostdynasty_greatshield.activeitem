  "description" : "Also known as the ''Double-Arc'' shield, this type of shield was the most ubiquitous ''Chinese'' shield. It could be made of lacquered hide mounted on a wooden frame, lacquered wooden plank, or wood with lacquered hide facing. Many of the intricate shields still used by the Dynasty are handed-down from previous generations, kept immaculate via mundane and magical means.
