  "description" : "Looks like someone affixed a crystalline wand over an antiquated pistol. But the pistol's receiver and hammer are connected to a spring system designed to launch a puck. Said puck is of a material consistent with the crystals of the wand. While it may function on different principles, it achieves the same effect as a Translocator Beacon launcher.
(This item variant is now old. Internal ID of this item is gic_psychic_translocator, whereas the updated one is now literally called gic_strangepucklauncher.)
^yellow;Translocator Beacon lasts 20 seconds.
^#D6DFFF;[ALT-FIRE] to teleport to the Beacon.",
