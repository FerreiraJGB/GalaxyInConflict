  "description" : "One musket ball averaging around 20mm in diameter. Ammunition of old did not actually have any form of standardization which resulted in various muzzle-loading weapons varying wildly in barrel diameter, falling upon the individual soldier to produce his own ammunition. Typically compatible with muzzle-loading weapons of larger bore diameters, such as those often fielded by Greenfingers.",
