  "description" : "^#8FAED3;Charges two lobbed shots. Attuned staff would be somewhat comparable to a double-shot incendiary launcher.^reset;
An elementary attunement powered-up to lethal levels. Whilst its older and weaker ''fireball'' cousin would remain a staple for most hardline traditionalist magicians, these lobbed fire shots have proved themselves deadly as field artillery provided the wand is charged by a suitable sorcerer. A weaker student may find their shot only reaching as far as 50 metres, unsuited for siege bombardment, but still enough for close-ranged fire suppression.",
