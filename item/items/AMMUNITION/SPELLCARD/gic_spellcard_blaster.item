  "description" : "^#8FAED3;Charges 16 shots. Attuned staff would be somewhat comparable to the performance of an automatic shotgun.^reset;
An attunement first pioneered during the early reign of the Dynasty. This spellcard focuses an extreme amount of kinetic energy in a few telekinetically-held projectiles (lead pellets are preferred, but gravel and sand can work). When desired, the projectiles are launched at immense speed in a cone of devastating shrapnel. Effective against hordes, whether that be against the Possessed, or an attempt at a worker's union.",
