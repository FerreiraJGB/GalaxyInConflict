Unlike spellcards of old, these attunement cards carefully prepared by the individual for their personal magic staff beforehand would allow them to ready their charges before a fight. In the heat of battle, one could reach for their spellcard as if it were ammunition and focus on it, recharging their magical potential far faster than if one were to have brought a traditional sorcerer's book.",
