  "description" : "A paper cartridge is one of the various types of small-arms ammunition used before the advent of metal cartridges. These cartridges were often coated in beeswax, lard, or tallow. The .36 Cal Paper Cartridge is much smaller than the 15mm Minie-Ball, and is in the process of replacing the cut-down Percussion Pistols, which have also been replaced by the Crow's Pistol.",
