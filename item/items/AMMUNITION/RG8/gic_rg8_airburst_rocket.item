Unsurprisingly, unlike its HEAT counterpart it ^#FFDD00;cannot effectively engage heavily-armored vehicles.^reset; This type of munition finds effectiveness in open warfare scenarios which allow for a much more predictable flight path for indirect engagements of enemies. ^#FFDD00;Only compatible with the RG8 Launcher.^reset;",
