  "description" : "The Minié ball is a cylindro-conoidal bullet with grease-filled cannelures on its exterior and a conical concavity in its base. The bullet was designed with a small iron plug and lead skirting, with the intent that the skirt of the bullet would expand under the pressure of gunpowder deflagration, causing the bullet to obturate and grip the rifling of the bore. Commonly sees use by Glitch Free-Thinkers who have reached the Industrial Age. A percussion-cap and required gunpowder are included in this item.",
