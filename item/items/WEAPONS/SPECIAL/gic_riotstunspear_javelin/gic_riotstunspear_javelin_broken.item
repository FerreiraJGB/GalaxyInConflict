  "description" : "^red;A discharged Riot Stun Spear. Cannot be used as-is and must be recharged or repaired at a Munitions Workbench.^reset;

Riot Stun Spears were notorious for being utterly useless in the face of actual spears, let alone firearms. Peace and pacifism often begets such ineffectual tools. Its utility still finds its way into the kits of Survivalists though, and serves just as well against wild animals as much as the animals of urban jungles.",
