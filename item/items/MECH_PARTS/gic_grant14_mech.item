	"description" : "The Grant-14 Mech Body is not actually a purpose-built mech component, but rather a scrapped ship-deployed ''buzz'' drone under the same name, simply hollowed out and refitted with personal mech systems. Consequently, the main cannon found on the front is non-functional. It offers decent enough protection, owing to the original drone's purpose as a harassment tool.",
