  "description" : "A questionable improvement over the Volt Coilgun sporting significantly increased firerate. The Europan Navy stated the original weapon ''felt unsatisfying'' and ''like spitting garbage''. Like the original design, much of the energy is spent on propelling the dense rounds. That energy is diminished quickly on planets with even a smidgeon of gravity.
