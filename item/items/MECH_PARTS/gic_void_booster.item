  "description" : "^orange;Basic Mech Boosters^reset; tuned for ^orange;superior speed in flight.^reset; Its acceleration leaves a lot to be desired, but the software responsible for controlling a ^orange;mech's ''max speed'' (in flight) has been increased to the maximum hardcoded level.^reset; This allows for high-speed manoeuvres for a relatively low investment cost. The only thing a pilot should watch is their turning circle, as the loss of speed can leave one extremely vulnerable.",
