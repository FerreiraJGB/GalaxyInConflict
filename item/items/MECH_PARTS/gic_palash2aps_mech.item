The Palash-2 APS is vulnerable to rapid-fire attacks, as the system cannot differentiate between cannon shells or simple small-arms. This means that the Palash-2 APS is most effective against high-damage slow-firing enemies, such as rocket launchers or cannon hardpoints. ^orange;A maximum of 20 active killzones may be deployed at once. 1s cooldown per killzone.^white;",
