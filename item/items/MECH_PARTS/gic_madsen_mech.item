  "description" : "The AK-1320 Madsen Mech Weapon is a ^orange;20mm anti-air weapon^white; fitted to a compatible mech arm adaptor. Whilst it lacks the same explosive power of a 40mm, it is much more suited for pseudo-dogfights between mech pilots, with its ^orange;VT-Fuze^white; ensuring that even near-misses will still hit the target.

The AK-1320 first gained a prominent buyer base on Gazri, where it was fitted as a CIWS-type weapon to most atmospheric-faring vessels.",
