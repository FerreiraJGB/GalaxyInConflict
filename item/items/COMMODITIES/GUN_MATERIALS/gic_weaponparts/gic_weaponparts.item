//  "An assortment of weapon parts forged manually, or stripped from existing weapons for reuse... for your pleasure and convenience: At best, this is an abstraction as nobody can be bothered to ask why you're able to rip out a shotgun's internal tube magazine and use it as an assault rifle magazine. That's on you. And a lot of the time, when there's no maintenance kits to be found or forged, that gun that you've shot non-stop since you found it has melted into a pile of slag. Fortunately, the one thing you can still salvage is a magazine. But presumably, sometimes you manage to save other parts and then use them for other things. A Galaxy in Conflict is a pretty gritty place but realism is just a diving board to jump off of into more important things, like existential satisfaction and not having your time wasted with excessive logistics...",                       //"Assortments of various weapon parts.",
