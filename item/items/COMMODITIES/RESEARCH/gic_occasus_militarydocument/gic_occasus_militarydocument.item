  "description" : "Insightful intel on the last-known military positions, tactics, equipment, and personnel of Occasus military forces. There is enough here to prove that the Occasus is far more organized than what many are led to believe: It gives the impression that there are completely separate forces out there, distinct from Asra's supremacist cult. The language this document uses, suggests that an unspoken xeno oppression exists; And that it must be resisted by any willing human at any cost.",
