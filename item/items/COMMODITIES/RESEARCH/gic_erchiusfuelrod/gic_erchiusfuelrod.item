  "description" : "A standard fuel rod compatible with most recently-manufactured human space vessels, or Letheia Raw-Fuel-Input systems. Letheia's attempts to monopolize control of the fuel market has been successful in all territories except those inhabited by humanity. Most create their own ''bootleg'' versions, using fuel rods intended for hydrogen fusion and shoving Erchius into them. Fuel Value: 3000u",
