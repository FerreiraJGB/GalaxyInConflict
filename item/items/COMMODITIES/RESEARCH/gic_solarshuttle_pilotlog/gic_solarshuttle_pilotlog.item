  "description" : "The final manifest of a crew that once piloted a shuttle. Handing this in to a Colonial Authority such as those at the Archivists of a Colonized Barren should yield a sizeable reward for the relocation of one such vessel. Its cargo of raw materials would yield resources that would find use in a refinery or factory. The ship itself could also be scrapped, where ship-breakers would get to work on recovering valuable components.",
