  "description" : "Dormant samples of Pericarpyx, a conventional parasitic organism that is not a lithoid. As such, it does not naturally occur during Erchius infestations, but can instigate one. That's why there are rumors that slave revolts in Letheia Mining Colonies do not exist (for long): Someone engineered this organism ''to make accidents happen''. It denotes an artificial split in the Erchius evolutionary line, utterly incapable of interfacing with a gestalt Erchius or hiveminds.",
