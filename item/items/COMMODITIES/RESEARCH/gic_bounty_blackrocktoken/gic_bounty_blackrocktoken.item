  "description" : "A token made from the same material commonly found in the blank-white Psychic Realm engraved with unknown runes which give this small object enormous energy potential. Its qualities are unknown save for its enigmatic properties of granting ''change'' in individuals who undergo a special ritual. For the Unbranded Novakids, these tokens are the key to stabilizing their withering bodies to allow them to live a normal and fulfilling life. Only by killing Great Warriors can the Unbranded survive.",
