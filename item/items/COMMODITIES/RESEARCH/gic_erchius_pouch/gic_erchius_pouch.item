  "description" : "''The Erchius Soldiers started carrying these pouches after a while. At first, we thought it might've been some sort of ammunition or even explosive charge, but the answer was a lot simpler than that. It was a sort of primer. A way for them to taint our dead and mark their frontlines. Every single one of them became capable of building their nests further and further, using our dead as their materials.''
