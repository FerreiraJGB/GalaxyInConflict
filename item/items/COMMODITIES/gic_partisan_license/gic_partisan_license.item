  "description" : "Provides proof of your Partisan Cruiser Tank License, to be used at a Colonial Spaceport to purchase a Partisan Tank. The Partisan as it is named is designed to be extremely cheap and affordable for independent pilots of the Galaxy, allowing rapid deployment in otherwise undeveloped settlements to quickly quell uprisings or sabotage. Its rather large size grants the crew incredible comfort combined with on-board life support systems, but should not be used in actual conflict zones.",
