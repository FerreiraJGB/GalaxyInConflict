A highly-energetic and valuable artifact most common at mid-depth RUNDOWNs, making these a very lucrative option for most RUNDOWN OPERATIVEs. Despite the prized nature of these artifacts, operative death-rates are significantly higher owing to the dangerous creatures that patrol deeper portions of the Bunker Complex.",
