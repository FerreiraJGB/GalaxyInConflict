  "description" : "They are liquids used primarily as a topical antiseptic, with many industrial and household applications. Despite being ethanol-based, it is denatured and usually undrinkable due to the bitterants added. When it comes to drinking rubbing alcohol, the digestive tract suffers the most, even when only swallowing a small amount. The body metabolizes these extremely high alcohol levels into acetone. If consumed to intoxication, the substance can lead to organ damage.",
