  "description" : "A generic ID card, typically belonging to a civilian or military individual. ID Cards are used to identify individuals, hence their name, but the theft of one can have major implications depending on how technologically-embedded the card itself is. Simple tags are harmless beyond image fraud, but IDs with electronic responders can allow for corporate and military espionage on a targeted asset.",
