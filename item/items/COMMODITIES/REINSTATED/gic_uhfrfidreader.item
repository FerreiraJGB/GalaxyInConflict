  "description" : "Radio-frequency identification uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of a radio transponder, a radio receiver and transmitter. When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader. This number can be used to track inventory goods, which still remains critical in the modern age of spaceflight.",
