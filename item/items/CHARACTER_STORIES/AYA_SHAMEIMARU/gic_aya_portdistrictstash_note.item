As you know, the Port District is closed because of a suspected Bloodwasp infestation. Utter bollocks. After they fired all of us they didn't give me a chance to pick up that stash of stuff we ''borrowed'' from management. If you're still willing, it's still inside the secret compartment in the cabinet we made for the higher-ups. Hopefully it's still there, because I see the place getting sealed-off now.",
