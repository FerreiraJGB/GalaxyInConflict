  "description" : "Bradley, I've replaced the lock to your upstairs study room with a keypad and digital lock. If you ever need the keycode for the room I've set the lock to 0430. I haven't gotten around to replacing the cellar door yet so if you still need to get in there the key will be in your study room cabinet. Don't forget to burn this note afterwards, since we wouldn't want anyone breaking in. - Your trusted neighbour, Alicia.",
