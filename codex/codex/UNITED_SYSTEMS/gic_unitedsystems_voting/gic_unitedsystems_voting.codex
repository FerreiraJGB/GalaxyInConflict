"PUBLIC INFORMATION FOR VOTING

The United Systems is a Representative Democracy and Stratocracy in that Citizens may vote after having served the mandatory military service at the age of 16 Earth Years, which effectively places the minimum voting age at 16 EY. Only those that have served the Age 16 EY Mandatory Service may be granted voting rights at which point people deemed as having near-full citizenship rights.",

"Citizens who are able to vote, do so every Presidential Voting Term, which occurs every 10 EY. Civilians who have migrated to the United Systems (and became citizens) after the age of 16 EY must serve for atleast 8 months in Active-Duty to gain near-full citizenship. Non-human Civilians must serve atleast 1 year in Active-Duty before being eligible to vote.",

"Human Citizens who have served atleast 3 years in Active-Duty service are classified as having obtained Full-Class Citizenship and are eligible for senatorial positions within the political landscape of the nation.

'The only people fit to run this nation are those that are willing to put aside their own wellbeing for the wellbeing of the nation.'",

"Voting is completed either through physical or digital ballots, processed through your federal division up-to the planetary division."
