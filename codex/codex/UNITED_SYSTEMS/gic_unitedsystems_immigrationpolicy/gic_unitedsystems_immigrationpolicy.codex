"Immigration and travel into the United Systems requires two visas. You will need to possess a valid Galactic Travel Visa approved by the Galactic Bureau of Intervention for travel within Human-controlled space itself. The Galactic Travel Visa can be approved at any GBI Public Department located on the borders of colonized Human-controlled space and in some systems within Hylotl territories. Note that applications for Visa Approval may take up to 1 Earth Week.",

"The United Systems Travel Identification Visa is required for travel within United Systems territories. You will need to possess a valid Identification Visa which can be applied at any United Systems Colony or Station within the Core Systems.

The application process for immigration may take anywhere up to 20 Earth Days. A mental and physical test is also required.",

"You must be of 18 Human Years old, regardless of the discrepancies in age considered in non-human species. For example, a Floran who has lived for 14 years but is biologically considered an Adult by its species is not permitted to apply for immigration until considered 18 Human years of age. It's a widely known fact that the seven current sapient species of the Galaxy live relatively similar lifespans dictated only by their living qualities with the Novakids being an exception.",

"You must have no criminal activity on your record within any human-controlled space for the past Earth year. Any activity considered 'criminal' within other, non-human territories is exempt and ignored.",

"You must be able to read and write the Galactic Basic English Language without the use of a neural translator or external translator servant.",

"You must have a basic understanding of the United System's history and government as well as an understanding of the major parties of the Fragmented Nation States of Earth. You must also understand the basic civics of America and Russia.",

"You must have a good moral and ethical value in relations to Humanity. You must also demonstrate an attachment to the Constitution of Humanity before being able to apply for immigration.",

"During your immigration application, you will be required to perform basic Military Exercises and demonstrate basic proficiency with firearms. You will be allocated to a group for 2 Earth hours to determine your mental and physical prowess. If you pass this, you will become fully eligible for immigration into the United Systems.",

"Once your application has been approved, you will be granted the 'Green Card' which authorizes non-citizens to live and work within the United Systems. Non-citizens are required to carry their 'Green Card' at all times. Failing to do say will yield a 100 Credit fine and 30 days imprisonment for repeat offences. The initially supplied 'Green Card' is only valid for 1 Earth year and must be renewed at any United Systems Colony or Station.",

"Possessing a 'Green Card' for 7 years and having established a permanent residence in the United Systems is eligible for Naturalization into the United Systems which grants full citizenship rights and no longer requiring a 'Green Card'. Full citizenship allows for previously illegal commodities to be legal for true citizens of the United Systems."
