"Intro

GiC Melee Weapons offer the short-ranged option when the bullets run dry and you have nothing left but a pointy stick. Unlike the typical Vanilla-style of weapons GiC melee is incredibly slow and short-ranged in comparison, rewarding precise attacks and mindfulness with greater damage output and effectiveness.",


"Weapon Types Intro

Whilst melee weapon types can be grouped into types, each individual weapon of both exotic and mundane nature will have their own nuances and unique special abilities, with some types not being listed because they cannot be applied to unique armaments. Certain weapon types tend to favor specific styles of regular and special attacks, but can also factor into their blocking and parrying capabilities.",



"Weapon Types 1

Sword - Includes the Longswords. Relatively balanced movesets with focus on mundane practicality.

Spear - Typically long-ranged one-handed implements. Special abilities favor charged thrust attacks, but have lower regular attack speeds.",



"Weapon Types 2

Rapier - Very fast one-handed implement similar to its vanilla brethren. Favors charged thrust attacks like its spear, but its damage output is typically low and every thrust attack lurches the user forward.

Axe - Very simple weapons that deal boss bleed on any attack but tend to lack range and speed, as well as sacrificing any complexity in its moveset.",


"Weapon Types 3

Halberd - Defensive weapon. Tends to have a slow but balanced moveset, with traits of the Longsword in its special abilities. Axe-head strikes deal boss bleed.

Katana - Weapons with the Iaijutsu special ''Counter'' ability. These weapons have standard damage and rely heavily on timed ripostes to cause the most damage, striking 2nd rather than 1st.",


"Attacking

The slower attacks of many weapons can be off-putting as it may be more difficult to accustom to the heavier-style of weapons, especially to those used to SB's vanilla-style of rapid attacks. Learning your preferred weapon's regular moveset, blocking and parrying window, its effective range, its inherent attributes, and its special alternative abilities is critical for effectiveness. GiC melee is still affected by attack power stats, and thus its damage can still be boosted.",



"Blocking and Parrying

Majority of GiC melee is capable of parrying or at least blocking. The distinction should be made that [blocking] is merely absorbing damage from a shield health pool, whereas [parrying] (or [countering]) relies on a parry-window to negate damage entirely. Not all GiC melee is capable of this however, and in that case should be paired with another implement that can.",



"Countering

These types of attack-parry abilities consist of an initial attack (such as a Katana's Iaijutsu) and the counter-attack (typically a slash-down). Countering requires that an enemy damage or strike the blade in the short counter-window it is active after initiating a counter. Successful counters will automatically follow with a counter-attack, dealing additional damage and stunning the target.",



"Boss Fights

GiC Boss Fights heavily recommends the use of the Red Sun artifact or its Cracked variant, as well as a melee weapon. All GiC bosses (as well as some minibosses) take 3x melee damage and the attack power tends to not be possible to simply ''tank'', thus necessitating parrying to negate damage entirely. Timing is king, and learning how a boss (or miniboss) fights is paramount to victory and subsequent engagements.",



"Boss Bleed (and melee specials)

Many melee weapons have a special modifier called ''Boss Bleed'' which is an attack or ability that afflicts a special bleed-like status effect specifically onto GiC bosses, as GiC bosses are damage-capped at 200hp per strike. For example, a weapon attack that does 3s of boss bleed will deal a total of 600hp damage, equivalent to 3 extra melee strikes (atop the strike to afflict it).",



"Shield Intro

Shields have a fixed DEF value. Damage dealt to the shield will be reduced by the displayed percentage, which will then be dealt as ''Physical'' (vanilla, NOT GiC melee) damage. Armor can be equipped which can further mitigate the incoming damage. STABILITY is the resource that normally functions as the [VANILLA] health, representing the maximum damage it can take overall before a Guard-Break.",



"Shield Types

Parry Shield - Focuses heavily on the parry-window, often having little or no DEF.

Balanced Shields: Mixtures of Parry Windows, STABILITY, and DEF. Can vary drastically between types.

Greatshield - Entirely sacrifices parrying for very high STABILITY and high DEF, but also cripples attack power unless using ''Formation Weapons'' i.e Soldier's Sword.",


"Shield Types 2

Anti-Missile Greatshield - Designed to be used against projectiles but trades away some DEF. Often has significantly higher STABILITY all-around. Multiple players can form a ''Testudo'' formation to protect against projectile attacks.",


"Firearms vs Melee

Even with melee as a nigh-requirement against Bosses, this does not make it ineffective in contemporary conflict zones. The high damage of timed strikes makes melee highly-effective ammo-savers in close-quarters urban environments against unarmored organic targets. Furthermore, any armament that can parry will be able to parry any type of strike; this includes Explosions, Shrapnel, Bullets, Cannon Shells, etc"
