"Hadern is a parry-focused Mortal Shell that when transformed, causes the user to become invincible for 1.5s. This shell is most effective when used to extend the I-frames from other weapons, or when caught in the open without a defensive implement (such as when using 2H weapons).

- I-Frames = 1.5s
- 25 ENERGY per use."
