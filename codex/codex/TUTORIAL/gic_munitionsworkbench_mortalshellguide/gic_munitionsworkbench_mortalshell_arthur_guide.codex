"Arthur is an unconventional Shell that unlike others, is able to move. Arthur is extremely fast and is able to levitate upwards (''extended jump'') for a decent distance. Decent for traversing distances, but offers no fall damage protection.

- Has no I-frames or defensive capabilities.
- Does not protect against fall damage.
- Drains ALL Energy on use."
