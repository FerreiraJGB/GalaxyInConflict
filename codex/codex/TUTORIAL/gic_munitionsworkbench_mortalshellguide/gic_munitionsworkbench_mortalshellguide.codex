"Mortal Shells

Mortal Shells are [Player Techs] which are equipped in the [Head] slot, sacrificing a Morph Sphere for the ability to inhabit the ''Shell'' of a Fallen Warrior. These Shells can make the difference in combat, where a sphere might not be optimal i.e Boss Fights.",


"Mortal Shell Functionality

One can enter shell form at any time via pressing [F] and is suitable for RANGE and MELEE playstyles. A shell provides defensive options where one's hands are already taken by a firearm. A melee playstyle can effectively extend a parry-window by entering Shell Form at the end of a parry, or save a bearer if their guard has already broken. Hadern and Solon cannot move whilst in Shell Form.",
