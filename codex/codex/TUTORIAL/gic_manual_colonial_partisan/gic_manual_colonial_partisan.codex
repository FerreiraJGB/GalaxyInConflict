"INTRODUCTION
The Colonial Partisan is a purposely-outdated Medium Tank designed on the fundamentals of cheap, disposable armored support in otherwise poorer star systems or planets.",

"ARMAMENTS
120mm AP Cannon (Driver) - Fires a non-explosive but highly damaging round. Reloads after every shot.
Coaxial 7.7mm (Driver) - Backup frontal machinegun for dealing with medium targets.
Commander Cupola 12.7mm (Turret) - Secondary machinegun for dealing with medium targets. The gunner is not fully protected, and can still take damage unless ducked inside the tank.",

"DRIVER USAGE
Movement Key Right (D) - Move right
Movement Key Left (A) - Move left
Mouse Aim - Aim 120mm AP Cannon / Coaxial Machinegun
Primary Fire (Mouse 1) - Fire 120mm Cannon
Secondary Fire (Mouse 2) - Fire Coaxial Machinegun",

"COMMANDER USAGE
Movement Key Up (W) - Man Machinegun Turret (vulnerable)
Movement Key Down (S) - Duck (invulnerable, but cannot aim or fire turret)
Mouse Aim - Rotate Machinegun
Primary Fire (Mouse 1) - Fire Machinegun",

"PARTISAN MECHANICS
The Colonial Partisan is a very poor option on a modern battlefield, and will not be able to withstand many rockets. Well-maintained Colonial Partisans may take upwards of 3 rockets, owing to the best of its armor quality, but if fully damaged, will become inoperable for 5 seconds before ammo-racking, damaging everything nearby."
