"MEDICAL INTRODUCTION

The Medical System is a core component of GiC's Combat System, directly tying in to the longevity of a player as well as effectiveness of sustained combat. Most medical afflictions range from minor wounds to severe debilitations which could severely impact one's options for a fight.",


"BLEEDING

Bleeding is the most common injury one can receive, as almost every bullet confers this type of effect. For easy guidance: Pellets and shrapnel confer Light Bleeding, standard infantry calibers yield Medium Bleeding, and anything bigger such as .50 cals or explosive autocannons yield Heavy Bleeding.",


"Light Bleeding deals a fixed amount of low damage over time, scaling with Max Health. Medium and Heavy are similar, but also have the additional effect of ramping up damage multplicatively for every second the effect is active. Most medkits do not heal bleeding itself.",


"BANDAGING
There is a common misconception that if an item does not recover the specific effect, then it is useless. This is incorrect, as BLEED RESIST is just as important. +100% BLEED RESIST effectively stops the bleeding same as removing it entirely, but comes with the additional downside of continuing to ramp-up damage in the background. For example, if you resist bleeding for 20 seconds but then re-proc bleeding you will continue the damage ramped-up from there on at a higher value than at the start of the bleed.",


"BRUISING

Bruising is the post-bleeding injury after Light or Medium wear off. Bruising reduces Max HP by 5-10% for 10 minutes, but can usually be healed very easily through common medkits. Bruising, like other injuries, do not deal damage to the player. Most medkits can handle bruise-healing.",


"BLOOD LOSS

Blood Loss is the post-Heavy version of Bruising, yielding a far greater Max HP loss. Whilst it can be staved off, the loss of maximum health can be a major disadvantage for future combat as it may bring players below the average rifle damage threshold of approximately 75HP. More expensive medkits can recover this affliction.",


"FRACTURES

Fractures are not caused by any bleed effects, but rather from a result of being hit by particularly large projectiles. These projectiles can include solid lead balls fired from an equivalent 16th-century musket, or a .50 cal projectile which should've ripped your body in half from the sheer kinetic force. Some medkits can recover this affliction.",


"OPIATE ADDICTION

Using Opiods without the required training or a particularly strong mind will result in the user becoming addicted to Opioids. This confers a very minor health buff, but letting the effect run out will confer the Opiate Withdrawal effect. Naloxone can be used to cure Addiction (or Withdrawal).",


"OPIATE WITHDRAWAL

Withdrawal occurs when a user addicted to Opioids doesn't get their ''fix''. Withdrawal is relatively short, but the debuffs it confers are rather brutal and nasty. Like with Addictions, Naloxone can be used to effectively cure the addiction.",


"BURN WOUNDS

Burn Wounds are caused by touching flames. Severe Burn Wounds are caused by touching Thermate. Don't do that. Most medkits can cure burn wounds.",


"PERICARPYX INFECTION

Pericarpyx is a silent and invisible infection only conferred by very specific isolated instances of Erchius Infected, outside of Afflicted Colonies. In its most active state, pink/purple Erchius particles will begin to release from the victim, as well as psychosis-induced sounds emanating from the victim. The only cure is the application of Pericarpyxanide, or death. Pericarpyx can be cured before its active state, but will not be known otherwise."
