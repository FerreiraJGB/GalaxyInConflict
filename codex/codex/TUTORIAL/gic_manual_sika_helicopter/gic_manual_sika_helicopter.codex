"INTRODUCTION
The Sika Helicopter is a primitive, but very cheap aircraft suitable for use on a variety of planets with nitrogen-oxygen atmospheres, relying on its 2 large contra-rotating rotors to keep itself stable in flight. Compared to most crafts of the day, it lacks any form of automatic stabilisation, and must actively be flown with extreme care lest a careless pilot rams themselves into a building.",

"ARMAMENTS [DESERT MIL-SPEC VARIANT ONLY]
Rocket Pods (Pilot) - Max ammunition: 9 | Reload time: 1 rocket per 0.75s (automatically reloads so long as there is an active pilot)
Frontal 4x 12.7mm (Co-Pilot) - 0.075/s firerate
Proximity/Guided Missile (Pilot & Co-Pilot) - Max ammunition: 1 | Reload time: 1 rocket per 5s (automatically reloads so long as there is an active copilot)",

"PILOT USAGE
Movement Key Up (W) - Throttle Up
Movement Key Down (S) - Throttle Down
Movement Key Right (D) - Tilt Right
Movement Key Left (A) - Tilt Left
Spacebar (Hold) - Stabilise the vehicle both angularly and vertically. Throttle is reset as well.
[DESERT MIL-SPEC VARIANT ONLY]
Primary Fire (Mouse 1) - Fire Rocket Pods
Secondary Fire (Mouse 2) - Start/Stop Engine
Special (F Key) - Fire Proximity Missile",

"CO-PILOT USAGE [DESERT MIL-SPEC VARIANT ONLY]
Mouse Aim - Rotate Turrets
Primary Fire (Mouse 1) - Fire Machineguns
Special (F Key) - Fire Guided Missile
Movement Key Up (W) - Front Lights On/Off",

"GUIDED MISSILES

If the pilot launches the Guided Missile, it will attempt to track the nearest target. If a Co-Pilot launches the Guided Missile, it will slowly follow the cursor of the Co-Pilot.",

"PASSENGER USAGE

There are no weapon for passengers. Maximum 2 passenger seats, not including pilot or co-pilot.",

"FLIGHT MECHANICS
The Sika Helicopter acts like, well, a helicopter. Its primary form of thrust is from its main rotor blades, meaning that the vehicle must be tilted to drive it in a direction. Throttling up, whilst tilting left or right will also significantly increase its horizontal speed, but keep in mind the vertical force necessary to keep the helicopter in stable flight."
