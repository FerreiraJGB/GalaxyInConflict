"Reloading

Reloading is an integral part of GiC's weapon system. A weapon will use a specific type of ammunition, and will automatically reload if you attempt to fire an empty gun and you have a compatible ammo item in your inventory.

Weapons can be manually reloaded with the SHIFT key. Chambered rounds will remain in the chamber, allowing for loaded magazines and the one cartridge already loaded i.e 30+1.",


"Ammunition Logistics

Ammunition is required to operate GiC weaponry. Ammo can be found as either bullets or already within magazines/clips/belts in contextual areas (7.62x39mm-type ammo is found in areas (factional)/dropped by enemies that use 7.62x39mm-type ammo, etc). In the former's case, bullets are visually identical due to their extremely minute differences (i.e 7.62x39mm =/= 7.62x51mm). Basic information on bullets can be found on the bullet itself.",


"Ammo Inventory Load Order

Ammunition for weapons capable of supporting different ammo types (such as the MK483 SMAW or USM-series) will prioritize loading order based on their position inside your inventory. Priority starts from the upper left-most slot, then checking rightwards until the row ends before starting at the left-side of the next row for ammunition to load. Some engineered munitions cannot be loaded into all types i.e Airburst can only be loaded into a USM60.",


"Miss Chances

Most weapons have a chance to outright miss a target. This is on average a value of 50%, but can be significantly reduced by crouching. Certain attachments can also reduce or increase chances for standing and crouching.

Most weapons gain a statistical bonus when switched to semi-automatic mode.",


"Recoil

Most weapons will suffer from reduced performance when firing for prolonged periods of time. Firing in short bursts, or switching to semi-automatic fire will improve accuracy and reduce miss chances.

In more complicated terms: each shot raises the recoil level by a unit which adds on miss chance and inaccuracy for the next shot, with each unit having a decay time.",


"Point-Blank

Most weapons have a short range where all shots will 100% hit the target.

This means that even if your weapon has a theoretical 100% miss chance (or more realistically, a high miss chance), all shots at a close-enough range will hit. One-handed weaponry usually suffer a minor range penalty compared to their two-handed counterparts.",


"Weapon Integrity

Weapons have a basic durability system. The weapon itself will deteroriate for every shot fired. Multiple types of weapon repair kits exist, with cleaning kits for maintaining guns at high standards to rebuild kits for guns that have nearly been destroyed. Guns can still function at 0% integrity, but performance will suffer harshly and are impossible to repair without specialized kits.",

"Scrapping

Most GiC weapons can be scrapped at a Scrap Workbench. Scrapping is useful for gathering weapon parts which are required for some craftable weapons or creating common forms of loaded ammunition i.e magazines or clips. Scrapping is a decent way of making use of excess obtained weapons, or weapons that have been driven to an unrepairable 0% durability."
