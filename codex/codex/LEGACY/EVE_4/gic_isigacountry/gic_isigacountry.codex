"Located on Eve IV, across the sea from Redya. Isiga is a 'Second Earth' by humans who preferred the Old-Earth life; without alien species. Isiga is a generally chilly climate and snows for most of the seasons, making it a great tourist spot for snow sports. Isiga, however has strict anti-alien laws and while most of the populace isn't 'racist', many prefer their lives without the interference of non-humans, resulting in Isiga becoming a target for non-human journalists reporting Isiga being racist.",
"These governing ethics span into xenophobic isolationism. While generally seen as detrimental to a nation's growth to deny entire species access, Isiga has become an extremely successful industrial power most notably in the weapons production of Battleships and Cruisers. Isiga is also the founding homelands of the respected Galactic Bureau of Intervention, whose role resembles that of the disbanded American FBI but on a significantly larger and more aggressive scale.",
"In terms of industry, both Redya and Isiga are engaged in an extremely competitive 'Industry War'. These nations are definitely friendly towards one another, despite their competitive spirits in terms of production. Both Redya and Isiga are close military allies of eachother. Although Isiga's land is not the greatest place for farming, the food supply flourishes thanks to the massive, mile-wide greenhouses built by TerraCorp. These farms dot much of Isiga's inland.",
"Isiga's history from being human-only allowed Occasus Members a place of refuge to vent their geniune racism. These groups of Occasus while clearly deluded, didn't commit any crimes so police forces tended to give them minor fines for dressing in Occasus gear. Surprisingly enough, the Occasus's attitude to the Isigan populace was friendly.",
"The destruction of Earth caused a major backlash against the Occasus living in Isiga once news reached Eve-4. Every Isigan Military and Police unit was mobilized and a country-wide crackdown was initiated, with every house searched for any trace of Ocassus sympathy lasting for a year straight. This operation resulted in the public execution of thousands of Ocassus members and extreme anger towards the Ocassus. Even Criminals helped the police with these operations."
