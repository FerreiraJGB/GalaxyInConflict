"The capital city-state of Eve IV. Redya is a peaceful country, and the new capital of all human affairs since Earth's Destruction. It is built along the Western Coast of Pantagonia, a large continent. The country, though boasting a military of its own, often resorts to hiring mercenaries in times of war. Although Redya is a very prosperous nation, it has no culture of its own; Redya's architecture, art and music were all borrowed from other nations, and merchants and companies make great amounts of money off of selling Redya foreign and exotic goods.",

"The country is led by a democratically elected senate, with no executive individual acting as the 'big man in office'. The Senate is divided into 2 groups: The Oldloyals, who wish to give more power to the government, and the Newfolk, who wish to give more power to the people. Oldloyals were founded on the Protectorate ideals, and Newfolk on the Unitan ideals. They coexist because the Unitan Commanders after the end of the first planetary takeover needed atleast 2 parties to complete the 'Democracy'.",

"Redya has a Tropical Climate similar to that of Hawaii and attracts thousands of tourists every month from both off-world and other nations. This comfortable Earth-like climate and different forms of Earth's countries combined into one has made this country a popular tourist destination for non-humans and humans alike.",

"Redya is not without it's industrial might and competitive edge. Both Redya and Isiga are close military allies with eachother and generally friendly with one another despite both countries being engaged in an 'Industry War'. While geniune rivalries do form, this industrial rivalry is vital for the healthy development of both nations."
