"Eve-IV

Eve-IV is a miraculous discovery that cannot be described with a single feature. Eve-IV is an Earth-like planet 3 times the size of Earth itself and 3 times the density with all-around balanced climates and biomes strikingly similar to Earth. The atmosphere has the perfect mix between elements, forming Earth-like oxygen compounds. Eve-IV lies within the habitable zone of a relatively young star with a singular moon orbiting Eve-IV.",

"Eve-IV was first discovered in 2072 by long range telemetry and telescopic systems atop the Russian Research Facility 'Kletka' atop the Himalayan Mountains. This discovery further prompted the development of human space technology and funding to the Space Programmes skyrocketed, developing massive ion engines within 7 months from its first development order. The 100 year recovery from WW3 and the ensuing space race eventually led to extremely rapid advancements in space technology.",

"Eventually after 70 years the first Gagarin-class Colony Ship was built. Running on a prototype Alcubierre Drive, the ship was populated with 2000 people and 50 International Scientists. The Ship entered Low Earth Orbit on the 17th of June, 2242. The first usage of the Alcubierre Prototype led to the complete disappearance of the Colony Ship from the Sol System and severe damage to the ship. The ship was assumed to have been destroyed and humanity would abandon the Alcubierre Drive for 10 years.",

"Humanity would soon return to colonize the Sol System instead without the usage of Alcubierre Drives but the dwindling supplies and staggeringly long sublight travel times necessitated restarting the Alcubierre Project. The Colony Ship however, crash-landed on Eve-4 on June 19th, 2242 warping out directly over Eve-4 without the momentum to remain in Orbit of the planet, leading to an atmospheric entry which damaged many parts of the ship.",

"Major parts of the Colony Ship's scientific data was damaged upon atmospheric entry. The ship crashed, destabilizing the gravity generator and instead reversing its polarity fields. This stroke of luck saved the colonists as the gravity was unsustainable let alone the 400 casualties sustained. The lack of scientific data pushed the technology of the colony back to the Information Age, restricting space travel for 20 years before the scientists would help reinvent it.",

"The Nation of Redya was formed on March 1st 2293 once the Colony had reached a population of 40k colonists. On August 9th 2301, 3 groups of 10k colonists each peacefully left to attempt to colonize other parts of Eve-4. These would later become the nations of Isiga, Free China and Europa.",

"On November 21st 2496, Isigan System Security established communications with the Martian Unity Federation. Tensions were initially high as neither had known of eachother but international Earthern intervention was able to prevent a war between the Isigans and Martian Unity Federation as well as welcome the humans of Eve-4 back into humankind.",

"When the Unification War reached across human space, Eve-4 was a listed as a potential target as being one of the few identified near-perfect Earth-like habitable planets. On the final years of the Unification War the Protectorate blitzkrieged straight into Eve-4, landing millions of interspecies troops over the cities of Eve-4. It would later be liberated by the United Systems albeit also leaving Eve-4 in debt to the 'Systems due to owed resources.",

"Eve-IV is currently governed by 4 separate space-faring nations, each supported by a city-sized Gravity Deductor that reduces the gravity to Earth-Like levels, planet-wide. 4 Countries exist on Eve-IV: Redya, Isiga, Free China and Europa, each with their own form of government. These countries tend to have their cities near the coastline. Between these nations are what the people call 'The Wildlands', unexplored lands home to thousands of undocumented wildlife and unidentified dangers.",

"The space-faring nation-states of Eve-4 maintain an extremely high amount of political influence due to their long history and sister colonization of space before reuniting with the other humans.",

"13 Billion humans currently reside on Eve-IV, along with many other species attracted to it's Earth-like heritage.",

"The sudden economic burst in the growth of Eve-4 is directly attributed to the destruction of Earth, bringing in billions of refugees adding to the planet's original colonial city status of 800 thousand to what it is now."
