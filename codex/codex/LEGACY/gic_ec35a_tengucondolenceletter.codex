"TO:

FORMER Jiangjun of the Far-Northern Frontier
Valiant DEFENDER of the DYNASTY and her PEOPLES in the remote regions of the NORTH. May fortune favor the bold, for it is the only true weapon one wields.",

"OFFICE OF THE DYNASTY | 
Dear Mr. Othniel:

I have read with deep sorrow of the loss of your son, Josiah. It is tragic that you have been forced to pay for the nation's defense with the life of a son. Please accept my deepest sympathy in your sorrow. I hope that the time will come when fathers like you will not have to make such sacrifices."
