"The Human Credit

The Human Credit is a universally-accepted currency used within the Core Systems of humanity, regulated by the colonies themselves as a measurement of demandite. Credits are extremely high-value, and are seldom used outside the banking systems of colonial services, as physical trade of goods should be equal in demandite, and not paid for in currency.",

"Credits are an accepted currency in the United Systems by few select companies but can be converted into the Unitan Electronic Currency [UEC] or its physical counterpart, the Unitan Physical Dollar [UPD]. Red Star Alliance 'Renbles' and Human Federation 'Federamarks' are decrepit currencies as of 2800 and cannot be converted."
