    "Spaceflight is a disorienting and sometimes terrifying experience for those who haven't adapted to the both exciting and outright boring aspects of space travel. This handbook will (hopefully) educate you in the important aspects when guarding, operating or repairing a ship or station that you have been assigned to. This book will also cover what to do in the event of an enemy attack and hostile boarding parties.",
	
"GETTING USED TO SHIP CONDITIONS

Ship conditions can vary greatly but for most Unitan ships, especially the Frigates, which are admittedly the most dull ships one could ever be assigned to. The Feline-Class Frigate is an example of an efficient but dull ship. Sickly orange lights illuminate the white metal walls, chairs have no padding, the tables are pure metal and the beds are hard.",

"It's hard at first (especially for the mentally-weak) to become used to dull, boring conditions combined with a small crew count but energy supplies are limited for Frigates and smaller scout craft which often have to scout for long periods of time (up to 7 months) before returning to resupply. It's recommended to bring legal entertainment onboard as once you are assigned to a Scouting-Type ship, you're part of that crew for the rest of your space travels.",

"Frigate OR LARGER

Above Scouting Frigate-Class ships, most staff (except pilots and high-ranking officers) are cycled every 4 months to reduce strain on the previous staff and prevent any unorganised spies from conjuring a plan within those 4 months. Larger ships tend have better staff facilities to accomodate many into forgetting the dangers of space travel but are also significantly more likely to be engaged in fleet skirmishes.",

"FOOD RATIONING

On ALL ships, rationing is top priority for crew without their own onboard farms as food is not expendable when in space. Rationing foods is important to extend the ship time without having to resupply or waste valuable war assets. All staff are issued K-Rations. EVA Engineers are issued S-Rations catered to the constant effects of zero-gravity environments. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSUME ANY UNSCANNED FOOD SOURCES!",

"OPERATIONS AND REPAIRS

Onboard engineer crew are usually assigned to deal with system malfunctions, hull damages and various other mundane tasks but ALL crew must have spent 2 months in Engineering Scholarship before being eligible for space travel. Basic tasks include ensuring systems are atleast at nominal efficiency. Oxygen Supplies and Water Storage is top priority.",

"HOSTILE ENEMY CRAFTS

A large amount of bandits roam the lawless space of the galaxy and while the United Systems has the firepower to take them out with ease. You should never underestimate an opponent, however. All ships are equipped with short-range Dual-Barrel burst-shot sentries and semi-automatic single-barrel guns. Main cannons are the 712-F22 which can punch through most armor and switch from AP to HE or even AP-EMP plasma shots.",

"When engaging enemy craft as a turret gunner, aim for the weak points in the hostile ships, both weak points in local shielding and the physical hull. When a shielded hostile craft is attacking, coordinate with other gunners to use AP Plasma shots to concentrate fire on an area to create a hole. Once the shield has been pierced the rest of their shielding systems will go down. To destroy an unshielded target, aim for weak points such as the engines, weapons room, oxygen controls or the Bridge.",

"If the ship is equipped with laser weaponry, it is recommended to focus all beams onto a single point to achieve hull rupture on larger vessels. When attacking smaller vessels, take advantage of the lightspeed beam and automated non-leading locking systems.",

"Sometimes, hostiles may be able to board and force their way into the ship. For Frigates, this can prove to be worrying at first but knowing your enemy is the first you should do. Standard Troops are relatively easy to deal with as you are on equal footing with them, with the only difference being equipment. Hostiles that are able to bring in vehicles are more problematic and engineers should use their rocket launchers to deal with such space vehicles.",

"We hope this book can keep you alive in the dangers of space. Don't worry too much though, because most hostile ships don't have any proper cannons. Looking at you, bandits."
