    "We have stood guard as the first line of defence of humanity. For hundreds of years we have expanded throughout the galaxy, claiming our rightful territories and spreading our way of life to those willing to listen to us. However, as we left the Core Systems governed by the countries of Earth it gave rise to those who have never seen how much we have sacrificed to protect them. Millions died to protect what they loved and for this thankless sacrifice, they were forgotten on an unknown world lightyears from their homes.",
	
	"The very ideals of the United Systems gave way to a way of life that was needed to survive hostile life. The boundaries between a Citizen and a Soldier were blurred that one could not function without the other. Every Man and Women was armed and every child was trained at the age of 14 to handle firearms with discipline. While not used for Assaults, these 'Citizens' were more than capable of defending a colony without the support of the dedicated military.",
	
	"As from colony-to-colony a shift in ethics could occur and loyalty to their defence of humanity had to be enforced. Weapons are a required defence and the collapse of a single colony could destroy entire shipping lanes and destabilize hundreds of other colonies and stations. Those that would rather lay down their arms in the name of 'Pacifism' were misguided fools who believed that the universe would be a peaceful place. Such a thought was a lie, yet this gave rise to a new ideal.",
	
	"The Core Systems gave rise to a new thought, a new ambition and eventually, a new enemy. The Terrene Protectorate, a charitable organization at first whose ideals very quickly became violent, destroying individual liberty as it spread throughout the Core Systems. Their idea of 'peace' was to forcefully unify Humanity under their control. In a surprise military strike, the Protectorate initiated a Unification War fought 2/3 by Autonomous Drones against what we had almost been Allies with: The Red Star Alliance.",
	
	"The R.S.A spread from Colonia, 22 thousand lightyears away instead of from Sol yet still retained a major military presence within the Core Systems. Once the war broke out, it became very apparent that what had been used to fight hostile Xeno Lifeforms now had to fight other humans. The United Systems broke neutrality once the bordering Core System of Eve-4 was attacked and almost conquered by the Protectorate. From here the entirety of humanity was at war with itself, again.",
	
	"This war would end with Earth undergoing a near-global Nuclear Fallout, the extreme battering of the United Systems, the complete decimation of the Red Star Alliance, Eve-4 suffering an Immigration Crisis from Earth and the rise of the devout Loyalist military who would rather fight to their deaths in the name of misguided 'peace'. That is, until humanity truly became shattered.",
	
	"The Earth became engulfed by an unknown organic entity that infested the entire planet. The Jewel of Humanity itself was destroyed as we watched its destruction live. Massive tentacles rising from our beautiful homeworld, shattered and broken. Even as we fell, the Loyalists continue to instigate hostilities against us in a futile attempt to restore their 'Protectorate'.",
	
	"We have become shattered again, now burning in our own systems."
