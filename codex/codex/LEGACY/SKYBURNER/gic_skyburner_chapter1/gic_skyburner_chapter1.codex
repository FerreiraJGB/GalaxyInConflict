"Skyburner was published in 2306 by deceased Author Aiden Williams.

This book is entirely fictional and does not represent any event on Earth. Any similarities to real events is purely coincidental.",
  
"Two fighters flew in formation. One of them, an F-15 with blue markings on its wings, fuselage and tail, flew in the lead. It was followed close behind by an EF-2000, bearing black stripes. The two fighters were in a cloud; nothing was visible without radar. ''This is AWACS Hawkeye,'' a voice said over the radio to the pilots. ''You're in the target area. The bombers are 2 miles ahead, they haven't spotted you yet. Skyburner 1 and 2, you may drop.''",

"''You'd better have our pay ready when we get back,'' Skyburner 2, the pilot of the EF-2000 remarked.

''That is, if you make it back alive,'' AWACS responded. ''Hey Catseye,'' Skyburner 2 said to Skyburner 1, ''This is your first mission, isn't it? I don't know why they made a rookie the squadron leader.'' There was no response from Skyburner 1. ''Hey,'' Burner 2 said again, ''You there? Or am I talking to a UAV?''",



"''Don't waste time trying to get him to talk,'' AWACS interrupted. ''He's not known for talking much. Just try to be a good friend and complete the mission.'' ''Well, I'm Gary Fawkes,'' Skyburner 2 said to Skyburner 1. ''Codename is Wolfhound. Listen, our survival rests in your hands. We can't bail out into a mountain of ice. I'm trusting you to help me out here.'' AWACS suddenly interrupted Wolfhound's monologue. ''The enemy B-52s and escorts are in range. Skyburner team, you're clear to engage!''",

"''Alright Catseye, welcome to my world!'' Wolfhound broke formation and dove through the clouds, Catseye close behind. They were high above the white mountains, and snow was falling around them. It was a breathtaking scene. Dashing between peaks, the two pilots kept close together, so close that Catseye could feel the heat from Wolfhound's engines. They made twisting trails between the cliffs, dancing gracefully.",

"Catseye always set his radio to a special frequency, which allowed him to hear both allied and enemy communications. Sure enough, the Morrigan squadron he was engaging had already taken notice. ''Hey,'' a Morrigan bomber pilot yelled, ''Enemy fighters! Two of 'em!''

''We're engaging,'' a fighter pilot responded. Catseye watched as a distant MiG-21 fighter turned towards him. Then, a beep- beep- beep filled Catseye's cockpit. He had been locked on to!",

"Catseye Quickly turned his plane upside-down and dove. The beeping stopped. Then, Catseye pulled up hard got a lock on the Morrigan Fighter. Before the Morrigan had a chance to break, Catseye fired a missile. It blasted the MiG to pieces. Two MiGs turned to fight Catseye, when one of the MiGs' wings were ripped off by Wolfhound's cannon fire. The Morrigan pilot ejected from his burning wreck. The second fighter tried to fire a missile at Catseye, but the rookie pulled up, spun around, and dived, blasting the MiG with cannon fire.",


"The last fighter turned tail and flew away. ''Save your ammo,'' Wolfhound said. ''The coward's not worth it. Let's get those bombers.'' But Catseye had already engaged the bombers.''Shoot them down!'' shouted a Morrigan pilot to his rear gunner. The three B-52's rear guns opened fire as soon as Catseye was in range, but Catseye dove into their deadzone the second they started shooting. ''No! We''ve lost him!'' ''Skyburner 2,'' AWACS questioned, ''Why aren't you engaging?''",




"''He took out those fighters just fine, I wanna see if Catseye can handle this himself.'' Catseye kept diving until he was only 2000 feet above the ground, when he pulled up into an almost vertical climb and locked onto the rear bomber, squeezing off a missile. The missile streaked upwards, into the B-52's wing, breaking it off. He then locked onto the second bomber, firing another missile, and then the third, firing on it as well.",

"The missiles both hit, sending the flaming beasts spiraling downwards, their crews frantically bailing out. Catseye ascended above the wrecks, and finally leveled off his plane above the clouds. Wolfhound returned to formation right behind him. AWACS spoke again. ''All enemy planes have been shot down. Mission accomplished! Return to base. Skyburner 1, that was an amazing first mission.''

''5 kills, buddy,'' Wolfhound complimented.",

"''You're already a quarter ways to being an ace.'' The two jets flew off into the horizon. ''I have a feeling that you and I are going to be good friends.''"
