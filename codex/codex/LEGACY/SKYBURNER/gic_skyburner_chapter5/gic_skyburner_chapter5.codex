"In my search for Skyburner 1, I spent a couple of nights in Restar city. While I was there, I happened to come across a former sailor who was on the Neygon when it was sunk. I asked him to tell me about what happened that evening. He told me he would, if he could keep anonymous. He said if anyone knew that he was on the Neygon, he would lose all his friends in this new land, and risk being fired from his new job. So he shall remain anonymous.",


"''I was much younger then,'' he said, ''much more eager to fight, full of energy and commitment to my country. When I saw that plane with the blue stripes down the middle, I figured he must have been some kind of commander.'' He continued, ''I was operating one of the anti- aircraft guns, a 40mm quad-barreled autocannon. I fired at him. But I couldn't hit him. No matter how many rounds I sent after him, he wouldn't get hit.",

"The missiles, I thought those would down him for sure. They didn't. And when he fired into the hatch, using our own missiles against us... I thought we were still invincible when I heard the blast. But then I heard the crackling, and when the water started rushing in through the walls and floor, I knew it was over. I pulled the flooding alarm and ran. Nobody tried to stop me. When I got to the deck, the ship broke in half.",

"Then, everyone started to get out. I'd say only half of us made it out. And we started swimming to the shore. Even fewer of us made it. We split up after that, certain that the city would stay in our hands. We were wrong. Well, I don't know what happened to the rest but I managed to evade the military and local police long enough.",

"A couple months later, I claimed to the city that I owned property here, and that it was destroyed in the fighting. So they gave me an apartment and I got an ID.'' I asked him if he would have gone back if he could. ''I would've then,'' he answered, ''But there's too much for me here now. I've got a job, a home, and a ring on my finger. There's nothing for me back in Morriga.''"
