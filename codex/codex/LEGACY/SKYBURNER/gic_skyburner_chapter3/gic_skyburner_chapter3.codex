"The late night calm of the countryside was interrupted by the loud sound of planes passing over. Skyburner Team, along with several other squadrons, had been scrambled to intercept a massive formation of Morrigan planes moving at high speeds towards an Allitarian army division. ''The enemy aircraft have appeared on radar,'' AWACS announced. ''All wings, break formation! You're free to engage!'' The Allitarians ignited their afterburners and accelerated towards their enemies.",

"''Good Glory,'' Wolfhound said to Catseye, ''Looks like they've sent the entire air force after us!'' Then, in a sudden change of tone, said, ''I bet you and I can clear ‘em all out. Let's go!'' Catseye did not respond. Instead, he pushed his throttle all the way forward, charging right into the Morrigan formation. ''Hey! An enemy plane's charging right at us!'' A Morrigan yelled. ''He's a maniac!'' A Morrigan flight leader shouted. ''Shoot him down!'' A squadron of F-5's locked onto Catseye and fired missiles.",

"''Skyburner 1, you've got missiles on you!'' AWACS warned. ''Deploy flares! Now!'' Catseye did not listen. He flew straight towards the missiles. Then, at the last second, when he could see the red-painted tips of the missiles, he pushed his flightstick completely forwards; the plane responded by diving sharply. The missiles passed harmlessly overhead, and the Morrigans could not believe what their enemy just did. Assuming he could not get back up to level in time, The Morrigans accelerated.",


"Then, Catseye turned his plane over and ascended, locking onto 2 enemy planes. ''I'm locked onto already? How did he do that?'' Catseye squeezed off a missile. It hit the enemy fighter, bursting it into flames. ''Catseye just bagged a fighter,'' AWACS announced. The other craft turned to engage him, but this left them open to another threat. Like a kingfisher, seizing its prey, Wolfhound struck down a fighter from above. Then, swooping up, Wolfhound fired a missile at another enemy jet.",

"The fighter turned over and dove, breaking Wolfhound's missiles. Wolfhound climbed back onto the enemy's tail, pursuing him. The Morrigan pulled up hard, attempting to do a loop. Wolfhound saw this and fired another missile. It did not miss this time. The rest of the group arrived. The combined might brought a swift defeat to the Morrigan raid. AWACS notified them of this. ''All enemy aircraft have been shot down. Skyburner 1, congratulations on 4 kills— hold on, we have a problem. Another enemy squadron just appeared on radar!",

"''Where are the decoys?'' A Morrigan yelled. ''They've all been shot down!'' another shouted. ''We don't need them,'' Their commander barked. ''Attack! Now! And destroy that blasted AWACS plane!'' Catseye pulled up and climbed above the clouds. Wolfhound, knowing that Catseye knew something was up, followed him. When Catseye emerged above the clouds, the Morrigan squadron was in formation, moving towards the AWACS plane.",

"''Curses!'' The Morrigan squadron leader yelled. ''Two of their fighters spotted us! Jak 2 and 5, follow me! The rest, down those fighters!'' The second he was locked, Catseye fired a missile at the Morrigan leader. As Catseye predicted, the Morrigan deployed his flares, so Catseye fired a cannon burst. The few well-aimed rounds brought swift obliteration. ''The captain's been shot down!'' A Morrigan pilot yelled. ''Stop those fiends!'' The three fighters sent to defend all charged towards Catseye.",

"Wolfhound fired on one, blasting his plane. Catseye locked onto one and fired a missile, then turned slightly to down the next with cannon fire. He pulled up hard on his flightstick, dodging the second fighter's wreckage. The last two, climbing towards the AWACS plane, fired their missiles. They streaked towards the observer. Before the AWACS's pilot could deploy flares, Catseye dashed close in front of the missiles, breaking their lock and sending them away into the air.",

"The terrified Morrigans turned their planes over and dove into the clouds. There was a bright flash, and Wolfhound climbed through the clouds, bringing with him smoke from the two downed jets. ''Thank you for your quick actions, Skyburner team.'' AWACS said. ''You saved our lives up here. All enemy jets have been shot down. let's RTB.'' ''Hey,'' Wolfhound said in response, ''How many kills do we have?'' ''Skyburner 2, You downed 6 planes in all. Skyburner 1, you downed 7.''",

"''Hey, look at that!'' Wolfhound laughed. ''7 kills! That makes 12 in your career! I guess a cute name like 'Catseye' won't fit you anymore.'' Catseye remained silent, as always. ''Hey buddy,'' Wolfhound said, ''How's Lionheart sound? I think it fits you pretty well.'' The two planes, followed by the other squadrons, streaked over the horizon."
