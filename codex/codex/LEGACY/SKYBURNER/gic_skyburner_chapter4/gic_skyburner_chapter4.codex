"The Allitarian forces had established a frontline just on the outskirts of Restar city. Morale was high amongst their ranks; if they could take back their capital, the Morrigans would be as good as beaten. Skyburner team had been deployed to launch surgical strikes against the Morrigan forces on the outskirts and the beach. ''You're clear for launch,'' said base command. ''Happy hunting.'' Lionheart's engines roared to life, and his takeoff was closely followed by Wolfhound.",

"As soon as they took off, Wolfhound took his position behind Lionheart, and they flew towards the city. It took an hour to reach Restar. Smoke rose from the outskirts, flashing lights appearing all over. ''Skyburner Team,'' AWACS said, ''You've entered the mission area. We're marking the targets for you.'' Red dots appeared on the HUD, marking the Morrigan ground forces. ''You're free to engage.'' Wolfhound and Lionheart went into a shallow dive. ''These bombs are limiting our movements, pal,''",

"Wolfhound complained. ''Let's try and get these out of the way quickly.'' A Morrigan soldier saw the planes coming. ''Hey!'' he shouted. ''Enemy planes coming in to bomb us! Shoot 'em down!'' The sky became dotted with anti-aircraft fire. Wolfhound and Lionheart broke formation, weaving through the field of hot lead. Lionheart flew directly above a Morrigan tank, and dove for the ground. Lionheart squeezed a button on his flightstick, dropping a large bomb.",

"''Everyone get out of the tank!'' Shouted a Morrigan commander, ''Get out now!'' The bomb directly hit the turret. The tank was obliterated. More bullets whizzed past Lionheart's plane. He saw an AA vehicle, firing its deadly rounds rapidly. Lionheart swung his plane around and dove on the AA vehicle, dropping another bomb. He pulled up as he dropped the bomb beneath him. Lionheart saw the flames beneath him.",

"''Enemy gunboats in the river!'' AWACS shouted. More red dots went up. Lionheart turned towards the river. He saw the gunboats, speeding through the city's canal. Striking them with bombs would be impossible. He dove towards the lead gunboat, firing his cannon. The bullets streaked through the sky and hit the water, dotting it with splashes until his stream hit the gunboat. The boat was torn apart by his fire; it exploded into countless pieces. He turned to another Gunboat and strafed it.",

"With amazing luck, his first few rounds hit the ammunition, blowing the boat to oblivion. ''Message from HQ,'' A Morrigan commander yelled to his forces. ''We've been ordered to retreat to the center of the city. We need to make it to the capitol. we have naval cover.'' ''There's no ships in the ocean!'' Shouted another soldier. ''We've got one,'' the commander responded. ''It's the Neygon!''",

"Immediately, lionheart headed towards the beach. ''Skyburner 1,'' AWACS said, ''You're moving away from the targets. What's going on? Wait- Our naval task force is detecting a massive submerged object just off the coast. All craft, follow Skyburner 1!'' As Skyburner team approached the sea, they could see F-18's taking off from the decks of the allied warships. ''They know we're here,'' said a scratchy voice in Lionheart's radio. ''Surface the ship so we can carry out our mission!''",

"''All ground units, seek shelter!'' AWACS ordered. ''The Neygon is surfacing!'' A massive black shape rose from the water, ascending sharply, then its front went down, causing a massive explosion of water around it. Countless guns dotting its deck became active, turning to the direction of the Allitarian fighters. A hatch on its deck opened up, and out from it came a cruise missile, launching up into the air. ''Neygon launching cruise missile!'' AWACS shouted. ''331st Armored, spread out!''",

"Lionheart dove on the submarine, releasing a bomb. It hit; but did no visible damage. Lionheart pulled up as the sky around him filled with bullets. He kept turning left to right, right to left, flying in a straight line would mean death. ''Crow team, beginning attack run!'' shouted the leader of the naval flight, pulling his formation into position above the Neygon. The flight of hornets fired their missiles at the guns of the Neygon, taking out a good number of defenses.",

"Another hatch on the deck opened. Another missile came out. ''Neygon launching burst missile!'' AWACS warned. ''All wings, climb above 5,000 feet!'' The planes rose sharply. ''Missile bursts in 10 seconds!'' Lionheart climbed over 3,000. ''Missile burst in 5 seconds!'' Wolfhound rose to 4,000. ''4... 3... 2... Bursting now!'' Lionheart and Wolfhound barely made it over 5,200 when the missile burst in midair below them.",

"Multiple warheads spread out over the surrounding skies, detonating and breaking into burning fragments. The few hornets who could not make it in time were torn apart. ''My engine's destroyed! The canopy won't blow!'' screamed one of the pilots. ''I've got shrapnel all over! I'm bleeding out! God please I don't want to die!'' screamed another. ''No!'' their leader shouted. ''All craft,'' AWACS called in, ''We've finished analyzing the Neygon. Shooting at the deck or hull won't do any damage!",

"You'll have to fire inside the next missile hatch that opens up!'' The hornet leader breathed heavily. ''You should have told me before I lost my pilots! They were so young, they had so much to live for!'' ''This is war,'' replied Wolfhound, angrily. ''There's no mercy in it. It's a collision of powers.'' Lionheart circled the Neygon, dancing through the hail anti-aircraft fire. Then, his radio crackled on again. The Morrigans were speaking.",

"''We got 'em good!'' laughed the hideous Morrigan voice. ''Fire another burst, and take out the rest!'' Lionheart dove again, straight down. The guns on the deck stopped firing as another missile hatch began to open. Catseye fired his two missiles the second he saw the opening. The rockets streaked vertically downwards. Lionheart pulled up. The two missiles hit the tip of the SLBM, breaking through its frontal metal. The burst missile's rockets went dead. The three missiles exploded inside the Neygon.",

"''No!'' yelled a horrified Morrigan. ''The entire ship's breaking apart!'' ''These are my last orders,'' said the shocked captain. ''Abandon ship and pray that the Allitarians have mercy.'' Wolfhound, Lionheart and the hornet leader watched as the Neygon cracked in half, and both halves fell beneath the waves. Their disappearance was followed by another large explosion in the water.",

"''It's sunk,'' AWACS said. ''The Morrigans have lost their superiority over our city. And... I'm terribly sorry about our losses,'' AWACS said to the hornet leader."
