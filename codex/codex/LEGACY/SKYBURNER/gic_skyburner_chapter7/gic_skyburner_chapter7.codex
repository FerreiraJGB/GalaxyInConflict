"The Morrigans had almost reached the breaking point in Restar. The city had been under siege for months, and the citizens were starting to openly express their hatred of the Morrigan occupation. Reinforcements might never come, and the Morrigan army in Redya was on the verge of collapse. The entire Allitarian military was mobilized that day. The setting sun covered the land and sky in an almost golden light, and the towering buildings seemed to welcome their former owners back.",

"As Skyburner team soared towards the city, they could barely hear the citizens on the ground cheering and screaming for victory. ''This is a big day,'' Wolfhound said. ''More than that,'' AWACS responded with a hint of joy in his voice, ''This is going to be remembered as long as Allitaria exists! This is going down in history! Now let’s give ‘em a fight worth remembering!'' ''Allitarian aircraft closing in,'' a Morrigan announced over his radio. ''The ground forces aren’t far behind. I’m sorry, everyone.''",

"''All wings,'' AWACS marked, ''Targets are marked on your HUD! Engage!'' The HUD displays of the aircraft lit up with green lights. Lionheart dove as soon as he could see one that was close enough, Wolfhound following close behind. Lionheart fired off a missile, and it streaked down towards an Morrigan artillery piece. Wolfhound and Lionheart pulled up, and broke formation. Lionheart was headed towards the highway, where Morrigan ground forces were moving through the city.",

"He locked onto a tank and fired a missile, moved slightly, locked onto another, and fired again. The missiles hit both the tanks, knocking them out. The vehicles behind them had no way of going around, and Lionheart watched as they were abandoned. Wolfhound had reached the airport. The Morrigans had parked their large bombers in the open. Wolfhound began to open fire with his cannon.",

"The shots flew through the air, slamming against the hard runway, then cutting through the metal bodies of the bombers. One would catch fire, the one behind that would lose its wing, and the next one would explode. Wolfhound flew through the wall of fire. ''Yahoo!!!'' He shouted. Then he saw one more, trying to take off. He turned his plane in its direction and fired a missile. The bomber’s fuselage broke in half, and began to skid across the runway, trailing sparks behind it.",

"Lionheart listened to the radio, which was full of the citizens’ angry shouts. ''Morrigans, get out! Get out of our city!'' ''Get this chopper off the ground!'' yelled an enemy commander. ''We’ve already lost this place!'' A Mi-24 Helicopter rose from the rooftop of one of the smaller buildings. Lionheart turned towards it and fired his gun. The tail broke off, and the helicopter began to spiral downwards. Then, Lionheart watched as a flight of friendly F-16’s bombed the highway, annihilating the enemy vehicles.",

"''We failed to win over their hearts and minds,'' a Morrigan soldier said over the radio, hopelessly. ''and this is the price we must pay.'' ''Shut up!'' A commander yelled at him. ''I don’t care what those cowards say! We can hold Redya, we WILL hold Redya! Retreat, and I’ll shoot you myself.'' ''May God have mercy on us,'' the soldier said, grimly. ''Skyburner 1'' AWACS ordered, ''Our citizens are being beaten back in area 32! Help them!'' Lionheart turned to his left, igniting the afterburners.",

"He kept going until he had a radar lock on the two Morrigan riot vehicles. He fired missiles. ''Skyburner 1, Fox 2!'' AWACS yelled. The missiles dashed downwards, ramming into the trucks and breaking them apart. Beneath him, the wave of citizens charged forwards, not even stopping to salvage any weapons. They were pushing up towards the Sonoma Cathedral, the jewel of the city. ''New message from HQ,'' a Morrigan commander said over his radio. ''All forces are to be redirected to the Sonoma cathedral.",

"They say ‘hold it at all costs!'' ''I see them coming,'' a soldier said, ''awaiting orders!'' ''Gun them down!'' the commander ordered. ''They’re just civilians! We can’t shoot them!'' ''Shoot now! Shoot that gun or I’ll shoot this gun!'' Machine gun fire came from the cathedral’s bell tower on to the wave of citizens below. Lionheart turned his plane towards the tower and fired his cannons. He fired until smoke began to rise, and then pulled up hard, barely missing the tower’s spire.",

"''Our commander’s dead,'' the same soldier said in despair. ''Everyone, stop shooting! Whatever HQ says is irrelevant! Our only hope is surrendering!'' The few remaining trails of bullets coming from the tower suddenly stopped. Lionheart caught glimpse of Wolfhound, cruising above the city. ''Hey, AWACS,'' Wolfhound asked, ''I don’t see any more shooting. What next?''",

"''Stand by,'' AWACS ordered, ''Keep flying over.'' Then, miraculously, a new voice on the radio spoke up. ''This is the 5th infantry division! We’ve intercepted the Morrigan reinforcements, and just finished the last of ‘em!'' ''I copy,'' AWACS responded. ''Look! In front of the presidential manor! The Morrigan flag is lowering, and... They’re raising the white flag! Attention, all units - We did it! Restar is ours again!''",

"The sky filled with the ringing of bells from the cathedral. ''Ring the bells!'' a civilian shouted. ''Ring them louder! Let them know that we are free!''"
