"The Morrigan War remains shrouded in mystery. Nobody really knew much about it if they weren't part of the government's elites. All that the general public knows is that it was a big deal that lasted from 1993 to 1997. Recently though, they released a bunch of documents from the war. A lot of them were Morrigan-written, and I had to translate them to understand them.",

"There was something they all had in common. At some point,they would start describing a ''beast'' plane, with aces as his wingmen, who would bring entire squadrons crashing down without trouble.",

"This fascinated me. I needed to learn more about this ''Allitarian Beast.'' With some help from a couple military buddies, I got a vital piece of information: his squadron was the Skyburner mercenary group. But when I got to the base, all they would tell me was that Skyburner one, the Beast, just disappeared. When I asked for his name, they just had me kicked out. But one of the mercs did tell me about someone who could help me. His name was Gary Fawkes. They say he flew alongside the Beast for most of his missions.",

"So, I tracked him down. I found him just on the border of Morriga. ''Yeah, I knew him,'' he told me. ''I fought with him. But I didn't know him. Every time we landed and I got out of my plane, I would try to catch up with him and see his face; but he was already gone. The few times I did see him outside of his plane, he was suited up completely; helmet blocking his face, suit covering everything else. I didn't even get to see the color of his skin.''",

"This sparked my desire to know the identity of this man even more. So, I began my quest across the continent to find out."
