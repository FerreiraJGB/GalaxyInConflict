"The beautiful blue water sparkled in the sunlight, and the palm leaves waved in the winds. The green islands and their white beaches stood here since the dawn of time, surrounded by the shallow, cyan water, and then the deep, dark blue. The Alani Archipelago had seen peace as long as it existed, the many peoples who called the islands home never felt hunger, had no thirst, no grievances, and lived together in peace.",

"In this region, on the largest island, the International Space Center was built. When the world was at peace after World War 2, the nations of Earth came together to launch spacecraft and satellites into orbit. But now, as with the rest of the world when at war, only one nation can hold it. Allitaria was lucky to take this isolated place in unclaimed territory. And today, it would see its first launch in 10 years. A reconnaissance satellite that would allow the Allitarians to see the whole world from above.",

"''Look at it all,'' Wolfhound said as he and Lionheart circled the launch tower. ''This is what science can do when it's not used for killing people. Where have those times went?'' ''Win this war and they might come back,'' AWACS butted in. ''You're supposed to be on patrol, not daydreaming. Return to the mission area.'' ''Sorry,'' Wolfhound replied, noticing his plane was off course. ''I just got distracted— Hey, AWACS, we're the only planes in the airspace, right?''",

"''Affirmative. At least that's what my radar says. How come?'' ''Because I'm looking at some, right now, coming in from the south at low altitude.'' Immediately, Lionheart swerved to the right, beginning to head south. ''Hey, wait up!'' Wolfhound called out. The AWACS plane began to move south as well. ''Dang, they already found us,'' Lionheart heard a voice over the radio. ''How many?'' another asked. ''Just two,'' the first one said again. ''Alrighty then,'' another said. ''Let's engage. They should be nothing.''",

"5 blips appeared on the radar. ''Enemies spotted! 10 of 'em!'' AWACS yelled. ''Wait... Those markings... It can't be!'' ''What's the matter?'' Wolfhound asked. AWACS was shocked. ''It's Red Squadron, Morriga's greatest!'' ''Not them, not now,'' Wolfhound mumbled to himself. The red-painted SU-37s of Red Squadron approached in formation. ''There they are,'' Red leader said to his squadron. ''An eagle and a typhoon.''",


"''Didn't we have a typhoon a while back?'' Another Red asked. ''We did, I remember it.'' ''2 minutes to launch,'' the space center announced. “Repeat, 2 minutes to launch.'' Lionheart dove towards the Red formation. ''Here comes one now,'' Red leader announced. ''Break formation!'' The Red planes suddenly spread out. Lionheart kept charging towards one of them. Just as he was about to launch a missile, the Red Terminator suddenly pulled its nose into the air,",

"slowing itself down as Lionheart passed at 400 mph, missing the Morrigan entirely. He pulled up hard, almost skimming the surface of the the water. Red 2 and 6 went after him. Wolfhound's cockpit was filled with a loud beeping. He saw the missile coming from behind, rolled sideways and turned his plane sharply, barely evading the missile. He heard the dreaded impact of cannon fire slamming into his side. He looked outside and saw his plane beginning to trail smoke, and a Red terminator behind him.",

"Seeing his wingman in danger, Lionheart turned in the direction of him, igniting his afterburners. A shadow covered his cockpit. Looking up, he saw a Red plane, and the pilot, looking straight down into his cockpit. Lionheart dove in panic, the Red pilot, number 6, watching and laughing. ''Hey,'' Red 6 said, ''look at those blue markings on the eagle!'' ''what about 'em,'' the leader questioned. ''That's the plane that sunk the Neygon!'' replied 6. ''He's here? With us?'' the leader said in amazement,",

"''Let's bring him down! Imagine the reward for us if we get him!'' Wolfhound's pursuer broke off before he could fire again. Wolfhound slowly turned his damaged craft in the direction of the dogfight. ''1 minute until launch,'' the space center announced. Suddenly, Lionheart's cockpit was filled with noise. Multiple missiles were approaching from every direction! Lionheart, with a rush of adrenaline, pulled up hard and deployed flares. The missiles were shaken, flying off in different directions.",

"Red 6, seeing he was just about to crash into a fellow plane, pulled up and began to climb. He did not notice that he put himself directly above Lionheart. Lionheart took the opportunity immediately, firing a burst of cannon fire. The shots hit the Red, tearing off its two tail fins and engine, causing flames erupt from the jet. He hit the afterburner and looked into the cockpit of the stalling Red. The pilot looked out in hatred and pulled the eject handle.",

"''A Red's hit and trailing flames,'' AWACS announced. ''Whose kill was that?'' But the answer was obvious enough. The other Red planes kept circling around. Red leader ordered his squadron, ''All craft, let's get out of here.'' ''What?'' Red 2 yelled back. ''We still have a chance! Let's finish this and stop the satellite launch!'' ''Negative,'' the leader said. ''We've already lost more than we've accomplished. All wings, return to base.'' ''Darn, man!'' Red 2 yelled.",

"''What about 6?'' ''We'll send an evac ASAP,'' Red leader said. ''Let's go!'' Lionheart leveled his plane off, hearing the Red leader order the retreat. ''Red squadron is falling back,'' AWACS announced. ''Nice work! The satellite will launch soon. We have a better shot at winning this, thanks to you.'' Wolfhound looked down at Red 6, parachuting slowly down as his plane crashed far beneath him, erupting into a fireball. ''Sorry, Alan,'' Wolfhound mumbled.",

"A roar shook the islands, and the rocket began to ascend into the sky. The islanders cheered from their villages as they saw the chariot of Oanu, their word for man, streak into the air. Their cheers turned to screams when they saw black smoke rising from the sea, and a man falling from the sky beside it. They didn't know what it meant. The metal bird had died, and for the first time ever, the Alani islands had seen war."
