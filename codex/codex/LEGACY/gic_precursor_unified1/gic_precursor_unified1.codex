"For years I have dreamt of a perfect galaxy. A galaxy where personal freedoms are placed above all else. No corrupt politicians, no systematic oppression and no wars from tyrannical nations. For too long we have been subjected under the control of the Government who have purposely fragmented us into warring states to further their own profit. War is good for nothing other than the money-making scum of Wall Street. Our voyage to the stars begins with peace to the Galaxy. Make us proud."
