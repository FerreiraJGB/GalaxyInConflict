"WARFARE IS INFINITE

The duties of a Space Infantry unit is vastly different from combat within gravitational combat. Every degree is a potential for incoming fire and armor is useless due to the already bulky nature of sealed oxygen suits.

The Final Frontier of Warfare within our own dimension is here and we as humans have already engaged in Space Warfare since the 22nd Century.",

"The suits issued to SIW Units are similar to 22nd Century gear but with the addition of more equipment pockets and magnetic boots for simulated gravity on outdated station designs and facilities. A nitrogen thruster pack is equipped on the back of the suit for mobility.

It's able to withstand a single 12.7mm shot to the chestpiece but is highly likely to fracture the suit and damage vital suit monitoring equipment. In some circumstances it may pierce the suit and leak oxygen.",

"Standard-issue weaponry can be easily converted for space usage through the addition of a foregrip, which reduces the fidelity of aiming in zero-gravity environments."
