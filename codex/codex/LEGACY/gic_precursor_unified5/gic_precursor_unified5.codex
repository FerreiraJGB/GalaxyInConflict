"How much must we pay for galactic peace? We have lost support from Aliens we once trusted to aid us in times of need. We have been backstabbed as they return to their warmongering natures against eachother as the now united cause of tyrannical Human Nations have formed to end our reign of peace once and for all. All we hope now is that our name may live on forever throughout the stars for one day our message of peace will spread back into the minds of the wary. Forever into the Stars we go forth."
