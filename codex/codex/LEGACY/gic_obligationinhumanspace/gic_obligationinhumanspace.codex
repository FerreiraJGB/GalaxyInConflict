"YOUR OBLIGATION TO HUMANITY!

Under the 2671 Commons Centauri Treatment Act, non-humans are obligated and enforced to strictly follow the same laws that apply to standard humans within Human-Controlled space. The rest of this book is a complete detail of every strictly established law within such space. Breaking laws as described is punishable by class types, varying on crime severity under the Interstellar Factors department.",

"[The next 200 pages is every single agreed upon law established within Human-Controlled territories]"
