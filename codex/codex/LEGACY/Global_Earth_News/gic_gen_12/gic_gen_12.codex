"THE RED STAR SHINES RED TONIGHT

The Red Star Alliance have declared total war on the Protectorate, rapidly spurring across the entirety of Sol. Mass fighting quickly ensued, with Protectorate Peacekeepers valiantly fighting and neutralising the hostile militants.",

"The asymmetrical warfare of space has limited its usefulness but remains a mainstay of planetary armored combat. Red Star Seperatists and Occasus in a shocking twist were seen fighting alongside eachother, confirming suspicions of terrorist collusion.",

"PROTECTORATE MISUSE

The Red Star Alliance recently sent out an international insult directly to the Terrene. Russian President Vyacheslav insulted their entirety 'Yeah of course you need help with that grounded so-called military! That's why they call you the Terrene Protectorate!'",

"AOI DECLARES NEUTRALITY

Alliance of Independents' President Abrams Tusk revealed that the AoI would not partake in the Red Star's war against the Protectorate.",

"Abrams Tusk argues that there is not enough of a reason for AoI to go to war with multiple countries that could ''very well drag our entire economy and many other habitable worlds into not just another Galactic War, but a war that spans over our cultural homeworlds.'' Pro-war protestors argue that the AoI should declare war to the Protectorate but it's too early to tell Tusk's decision to stay neutral in the war."
