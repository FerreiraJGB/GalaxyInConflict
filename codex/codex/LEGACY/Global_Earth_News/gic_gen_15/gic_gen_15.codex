"JAPAN FIRES KINETIC RODS AT ITSELF

A recent aerial invasion of Japan by the Protectorate caused the rapid and swift unconditional surrender of Japanese Militants back into Protectorate hands. The Red Star Alliance were unable to defend Japan, revealing their innate weakness unlike the Alien.",

"As the Protectorate wrestled control over Japan, the Japanese Militants did the unthinkable in the face of both allies and enemies. The Japanese fired nuclear-tipped kinetic rods from a WMD space station at themselves. No Peacekeepers were killed. Drone Peacekeeping forces have been sent to search for survivors.",

"DRONE PEACEKEEPERS AUTHORISED

Under direct order by Julark, Protectorate Synthetic Forces have been authorised to act independently in the control and containment of violent insurrectionists and other human supremacist movements. PSFs are highly intelligent. Treat them as you would treat others.",

"PROXIMA B MEGACITY WIPED

The Megacity established on Proxima B in Alpha Centauri has been completely wiped via the use of excessive orbital bombardment by the Red Star Alliance after the city's local Government sect refused to surrender to the localised Occasus rebellion.",

"COLONIA UNDER ATTACK

As thousands of refugee ships flood to Colonia, located at a staggering 22k lightyears away from Sol, news from Colonia has confirmed reports of Occasus Warships demanding the surrender of all military and police personnel. Local System Security vessels have surrendered with the Red Star seeming intent on holding Colonia away from the Protectorate's control.",

"TITAN REFINERIES DESTROYED

The major Fuel Refineries located on Saturn's moon: Titan, was recently destroyed by a stray 200mm Kinetic Shot fired by a rogue human supremacist. The damage was recorded as levelling every structure within a 500 kilometre radius."
