"SENATE ROTATION IN EFFECT

Grand Protector Julark released a public speech for his campaign yesterday: ''Citizens of Humanity, we have reached an age of tranquility and peace that hasn't been achieved for over a hundred years. For these years we warred among ourselves for no purpose, no reason, and with no hope. Tomorrow, this all changes.",

"Under our rule, and we will make humanity thrive again. We will bring back what made us a spacefaring species, what we did when we were still young. When we banded together in the name of peace, we took our first steps into the stars, not competing, but working with eachother not as enemies, but as friends, allies. The Protectorate will improve this galaxy. We will collaborate with the Galactic Community and bring forth a new age of peace and prosperity. Thank you.''",

Salvaged camera data revealed the couple engaging in sexual intercourse. 17 minutes and an unidentified pirate ship appears to have used Beam Lasers to overheat the ship, burning the couple of the Type-7 alive. No further footage was salvageable.",

"PROTESTS OVER APEX ON ALPHA CENTAURI PROXIMA B

Many are saying these action are unjustifiable, and that they are nothing more than to 'increase the effectiveness of police brutality'.",
