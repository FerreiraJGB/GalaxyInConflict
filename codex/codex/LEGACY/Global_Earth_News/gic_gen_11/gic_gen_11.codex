"THE ROPE TENSIONS

The Red Star Alliance openly remarked disgust at the ongoing situation in the Core Worlds, referring to it as ''A repeat of WW3''. The Red Star Alliance threaten to declare war on the Protectorate if they ''refuse to leave humanity.'' Non-aligned nations are urging to prepare for war and thousands of Doomsday Preppers have voiced their 'rightousness'.",

"UNDER THREAT

The United Systems has released no comment as a whole on the increasing tensions of the Core Systems Territories. While it is evident that fleets are patrolling the borders connecting the United Systems to the Core Systems it is unclear if they will actually join the predicted war. Human Supremacists have taken this opportunity to smuggle weapons from the United Systems.",

"TERRENE UTOPIA

Earthern states of the Protectorate have been systematically recognized as being the most 'utopian' of all societies. Towering skyscrapers far higher than the lower cloud layers supported by anti-gravity supports and lush greenery make the Earthern Territories as beautiful as it was pre-WWW3 thanks to our Alien Friends."
