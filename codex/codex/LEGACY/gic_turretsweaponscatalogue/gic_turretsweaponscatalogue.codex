These weapons will be guaranteed to keep you alive from any threat that may appear!",

"M712-F22

This automated turret is the cheapest civilian turret out on the human weaponry market. Extremely versatile, it's able to punch through extremely thick armor and shields with its small single-barrel plasma gun. It's no wonder the United Systems use these for their Frigates. Their only downside is the abysmal turn rate of 8 seconds for a full revolution and extremely demanding power usage.",

"M-Autocannon

The M-Autocannon is a quad-barreled 12.7mm turret with thick armor and decent frontal sloping. Shots are extremely accurate for what it is and recoil is nonexistant allowing for minimal interference of ship flight. The low power usage and relatively low maintenance design makes a popular choice for pilots within high-security systems. It's effective against most targets but unfortunately, does rather poorly against shielded targets.",

"M-Cannon

The M-Cannon is the single-barrel 190mm equivalent of the M-Autocannon. It uses a nano-fabricator to create live rounds from connected Nano-Resources and allows for a relatively 'hands-off' approach as there's no need to for an external ammunition box or from a supply belt connecting to the internal storage of the ship. It's extremely devastating, able to rip through most smaller ships in a single shot.",

"M-Pulse

The M-Pulse is based on an old 21st Century human design of an early form of laser weaponry. It fires a near-invisible 'heat ray' which can reach temperatures up to 2500 Kelvin. Not particularly effective at destroying ships as it merely melts the hull but extremely powerful against shields utilizing thermal overloading. It does however suffer from an extremely demanding power usage but that's to be expected from Energy weaponry."
