    "UNITANS

'Unitan' refers to the nickname given to the ethnic citizens of the United Systems.",

"Their origins stem as a mere off-world variant of the American Confederation, having consisted of a small Expeditionary Force and a relatively decently sized fleet only rivalled by that of the Red Star Alliance, which at that time had the galaxy's largest ship and the legendary Mir-2 Ion Cannon. The United Systems as a colonial off-world defence military was established in the 26th Century.",

"The United Systems were originally directly given orders by the nation-states of Earth prior to First Contact with the Florans. Military Colonies would be established far from human-space which at the time had only expanded to 28 lightyears while the United Systems had been establishing colonies over 100 lightyears away from Sol. Over time, the long dwindling period of peace between the major powers of humanity resulted in massive funding reductions, until the alliance was in name only.",

"During the attempted disbanding of the United Systems, a declaration of independence was broadcasted to the major powers of humanity, firmly establishing themselves as an independent power separate from the Core Systems. Under the cooperative rule of Governors; hundreds of stations and colonies were able to establish stable trade relations with other colonies/",

"As these colonies were founded on the basis of military units, a chain of command was quickly established and the ruling government established. A democracy, formed by the highest-ranking members of the United Systems which would then lead to the construction of the United Systems Bureacracy: High Command. This fully functioning government and trade allowed a flourishing society to form, fully justifying their independence. It remained as it was for 160 years.",

"As time passed, it was recognised that the United Systems was on the outside of the human Core Systems, effectively forming a small shield pointing towards Sagittarius A*. Under strict supervision, the USCM were permitted to build outposts within the United Systems. This would prove to become a business 18 years to come.",

"First Contact with the Florans and thousands dead as colonies are being raided and destroyed. Local police forces are unable to stop the wave of Florans who despite being armed with nothing more than spears and knives; were fully capable of using teleportation technology and performing Darkspace jumps to other systems. This became the turning point of what would turn an alliance of colonies into a fully fledged space-faring nation and ultimately, what gave them their superpower status.",

"As colonies fell one-by-one, mandatory military service was instated. Every single able-bodied man and woman were trained in the operation of firearms and personal weaponry became mandatory in the defence of colonies under a strict oath of loyalty to the United Systems. It was a do-or-die situation for them and there was no running as the fall of the United Systems would bring destruction to the rest of humanity. This invasion caused multiple independent powers to align and fund the United Systems.",

"The USCM joined the fight in the combined efforts to defend against the Florans as the United Systems began their first steps into extreme militarization. While major scrutiny was directed at the United Systems, there was no doubting the necessity for every able-bodied person to defend against an enemy who would decide to 'Hunt' every single human in sight.",

"The modern United Systems is now a Stratocracy, in which only those that have completed mandatory service at the age of 16 are eligible to vote. The United Systems maintains a militaristic government under the impression of hostility by the Avian Unified Theocratic Stargazers and the Apex Unified Miniknog. Under constant apparent threat the United Systems keeps its military in check and often performs military exercises as a show of force to intimidate other powers; human or not."
