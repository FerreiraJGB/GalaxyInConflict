"[Excerpt from registration requirements]

In order to legally own and operate a dedicated Hyperspace drive within human-controlled space you must be in possession of an armed frigate-class vessel approved by a qualified Ship Arms Dealer. A ship outfitted directly for combat is recommended due to the adverse effects of Hyperspace travel. Being in possession of a Hyperspace Drive without a license is punishable by court-martial.",

"Your ship must be equipped with a Camera for recording your entire voyage, station-to-station. You must also have atleast handed in and claimed atleast 100 bounty vouchers which also must be recorded at the Interstellar Factors. This is to confirm your combat capabilities as a pilot as travel through Hyperspace includes unfavorable results with dimension breaching. Various creatures; mostly hostile; may appear due to the Hyperspace Drive.",

"As your camera must remain on throughout your journeys, failure to surrender camera footage to station or system security is punishable by death. Each confirmed kill of an extra-dimensional creature grants 5000 credits. Proof of refusing to scan the immediate area for extradimensionals or refusing to fire upon extradimensionals is punishable by court-martial with a maximum sentence of 80 years imprisonment.",

"Extradimensionals materializing within your own ship grants a 50k credit reward for a live specimen turned in at any human-controlled station. Specimen must be restrained upon docking. If restraining of the creature is impossible, radio ground/station crews for an armed escort. Your ship will be quarantined and transported to a containment facility as well as the retrieval of the security data while the specimen is retrieved. This process may take up to 24 hours for your ship to be returned.",

"Hyperspace Drives can be bought at these stations: [A large list of stations appears here, mostly being situated within human-controlled space but some dot Apex Resistance and Floran Liberation Front space]"
