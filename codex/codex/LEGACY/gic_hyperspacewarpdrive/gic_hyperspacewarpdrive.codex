"The Dedicated Hyperspace Drive is the modern form of the Darkspace Warp of the last century. A Drive capable of warping extreme distances up to 400 lightyears in one jump. Designed by Yuktone Grel Corporation, it's a drive-type restricted only to those with a special license which permits pilots to operate the dangerous tech. Similarly, any form of magnetic interference such as from solar winds and star fields immediately drops a ship out of warp. No warp exists for inter-system travel.",

"First developed onboard the Ocellus Starport ''Ackers Lab'' in the Rasalhague system. During their final experiment before the shutdown of the lab, what was originally the function used to jump to Darkspace revealed another form of dimensional breaching in which a new region of space was discovered. Further tests with ships outfitted with this experimental tech yielded extremely successful results having jumped 30 lightyears within a second.",

"In an attempt for further results, Ackers Lab permitted the decision to test the possibility of jumps beyond 30 lightyears. Russel Grel was the first to volunteer to jump to another star system. Russel Grel jumped out of the Rasalhague system using mass-lock onto a star 80 lightyears away. No traces remain of this test as Russel Grel was presumed dead after 2 Earthern days of no return.",

"The test was replicated via the use of an early-build Semi-Sapient Military S.A.I.L using the navigational beacon lock instead. The ship equipped with the replicated prototype arrived at Washington Station with time difference equating to 47 seconds. 22 additional tests were conducted with mass-lock and beacon-lock. All tests conducted with mass-lock Hyperspace jumps were reported missing, assumed destroyed by the stars of their destination systems. All tests conducted with Beacon locks yielded safe passage.",

"9 Earth Hours after the Hyperspace tests however, unidentified creatures emerged from the high-wakes left behind by the Hyperspace tests. Seemingly organic creatures spawned in 12 different systems each in the destinations of successful Hyperspace jumps. It was this discovery that this type of Drive was withheld from the public for 50 years until Ackers Lab released their full experimentation logs and data to the public. It was internationally agreed upon that civilian use was off-limits.",

"Now, the Hyperspace drive is restricted for military vessel usage and civilians who are in possession of ships with the firepower of atleast a United Systems Frigate.",






"LIST OF ANOMALIES - EDITED FOR PUBLIC EYES AND APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE OF INTERGALACTIC ETHICS

- Purple Crystals - Later identified as Erchius

Samples of Erchius Crystals appeared in the 10 high-wake breach cases. No discrepancies from standard Erchius. Incinerated.",

"- 20th Century Seaplane

A United States Navy PBM3S Patrol Seaplane covered in a various aquatic corals (later identified as originating from Earth) was recovered within the hangar bay of an Aktue Capital Vessel from a routine military test on capital-class ships equipped with Hyperspace Drives.",

"- Space Whale

A large ocean whale; Physeter macrocephalus was found floating dead next to the crumpled wreckage of the 9th Beacon-lock ship. A short investigation concludes that both dropped out of Hyperspace at the same time, colliding into and inside of eachother until the atomic rupture of both objects."
