"Humanity has fallen. The Protectorate have launched a final desperate attack upon the people. Multiple WMDs detonated across the Earth, each equating to 8000 kilograms of TNT. Heavily affected locations include Moscow, New York, Sydney, Tokyo and many others that have fallen to the tyranny of the Protectorate. The Motherland, our headquarters has fallen to these Nuclear Weapons and Earth can no longer sustain an effective resistance military. Our numbers are few and far between and we have lost the battle.",

"All remaining soldiers, no matter your rank, battalion or ethnicity: You are the last of the Red Star Alliance. Earth is gone. Many have been subjugated under the Protectorate's rule. Those that have resisted have been destroyed. Your final orders to locate and regroup with remaining Red Star units and retreat to the United Systems. We have sent our final message to the Unitans. They will be waiting for you to join their ranks. You are to listen to their orders.",

"The United Systems is the last hope of Humanity's freedom. Long live the Red Star Alliance. Long live the last liberators of humanity."
