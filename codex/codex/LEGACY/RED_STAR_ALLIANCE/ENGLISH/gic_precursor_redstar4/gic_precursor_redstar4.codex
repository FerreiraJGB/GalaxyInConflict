"The Protectorate in the recent days have rolled out what appears to be Robotic Soldiers. Heartless, cold-blooded killing machines of war. No longer are we fighting the true army of the Protectorate, but the heartless steel of Robotic Armies marching across burning grass. These machines cannot be reasoned with. They do not care of the difference between a civilian or soldier. They need no food or light to sustain their rampage across the Earth. We are fighting an enemy worse than the Protectorate, only sustained by such Empire."
