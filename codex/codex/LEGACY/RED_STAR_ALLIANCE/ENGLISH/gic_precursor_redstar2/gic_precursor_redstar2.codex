"Our Red Star Alliance is the forerunning life blood of the Pacific. For years we have held the line against the tyrannical and oppressive Protectorate. Under the guise of Galactic Peace, they have forced upon others their idealogies of Authoritarian Castes and even genocide against our own people! Their act of lies and hypocrisy will end by our hands, for which we will rebuild our once-standing race and unify it under a human-wide federation. That day will be when true peace will be achieved by our hands."
