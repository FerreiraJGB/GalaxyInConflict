UPDATED [ERROR AUTO MESSAGE], IN ACCORDANCE TO ANOMALOUS INCIDENTS

DEPARTMENT OF CONTAINMENT | BUREAU OF UNUSUAL INCIDENTS",

"If you are receiving this message: we're sorry. The psychic energies have cooked up hyper-storms across the entire planet, effectively freezing the entire atmosphere into something barely survivable. Your planet, among many others, have reached levels that can no longer sustain plant-based surface life, with off-world transportation no longer feasible due to an impossibly high risk of engine freezing and the violent cryo-warping of space-grade alloys. Recovery is impossible.",

"Your best chances are underground, within remaining metro tunnel systems. But we can't guarantee safety there from any harmful psychic entities. As a rule of thumb, stay away from any locations where a violent amount of deaths have occurred within a short amount of time. These are prime spots for harmful entities to appear, with rare cases of outright possession occurring. Further psychic interference will soon make any off-world communications impossible.
Stay safe, stay vigilant, stay alive."
