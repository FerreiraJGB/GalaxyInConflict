"The Miniknog Military, the most technologically advanced civilization out there and yet their resources and efforts are wasted in attempting to oppress their own people with no benefit in itself. They are a Global Unified Government under a brutalistic Authoritarian Dictatorship, similar to the Protectorate. This public report will focus on their basic military prowess and general tactics.",

"INFANTRY UNITS

The Miniknog Troops are clad in titanium armor coated in a sort of energy shield that can withstand most laser shots but the quality of the armor is negligible, shattering the welds upon being impacted by a 5.56mm bullet. Their armor slows them down significantly and their helmets actually reduce their vision. No standard-issue firearm is consistent with any soldier.",

"GROUND VEHICLES

The Miniknog surprisingly have absolutely no ground vehicles other than their highly ineffective 'Apex Mech'. Weapons may vary but the overall design is extremely clunky.",

"AERIAL VEHICLES

The Miniknog have no confirmed atmospheric aerial vehicles. Despite this, it is still enforced that installations be equipped with basic atmospheric anti-air defenses.",

"GROUND TACTICS

No known tactics have been identified that differ from straightforward charging and firing of their rifles.",

"SPACE VEHICLES

Admittedly, their military space fleets are significantly better than ours due to their absolutely devastating plasma weaponry and high-capacity shields which renders AP Plasma Shots ineffective. Their standard ship design is roughly diamond shaped with guns strapped all around and stupidly effective shielding. Best way we can take these ships out is by concentrated fire of HE rounds or boarding parties.",

"SPACE TACTICS

Same as their ground tactics. No utilization of any special tactics have been identified apart from rare instances of ambushes from Darkspace or Hyperspace jumps."
