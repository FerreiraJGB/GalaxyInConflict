"The Alcubierre Warp Drive is currently the most commonly operated warp drive across the entire galaxy. It is a Drive capable of travelling almost anywhere and is universally recognised as the first method of Faster-Than-Light travel for space-faring empires. While not as fast as the Dedicated Hyperspace or Wormhole Drives it provides the cheapest, safest and surest way to travel between star systems.",

"Used by all, the Alcubierre Warp Drive is based on an Old-Earth concept designed on Earth in 1994 AD-E by Miguel Alcubierre but hypothesized even earlier by an entertainment television show known as 'Star Trek' which has been shunned for its overly romanticized view of today's 'future'. Experiments were done on Earth as early as 2012 AD-E by the century-old bankrupt NASA Space Agency using an Inteferometer to detect spatial distortions. Results from this Old-Earth experiment has long been lost, however.",

"The Alcubierre Drive functions primarily by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, which results in effectively a form of Faster-Than-Light travel. A configurable energy-density field lower than that of vacuum is created in order to control the speed at which the Drive functions at. This state is known as 'Hypercruise' in which the Drive is able to allow ships to move up to 500 times the speed of light. As the Drive is not actually moving, no visual distortion occurs from Hypercruise.",

"Hypercruise can return ships to normal spatial relativity but will do so at an absolute speed of 0 outside of a large enough magnetic presence. A standard solar system is enough to synchronise exit speed with the system. Being near a planet will synchronise with that planet's solar orbit. Note that the synchronised exit speed does not exit in a stable orbit. Thrusters will be required to create an orbit. Exiting near a large station will essentially place you in orbit of the planet.",

"A high enough magnetic presence can however prevent the entering of Hypercruise and forcefully eject ships from Hypercruise. The standard ejection distance is 400km from a large station.",

"A secondary 'Darkspace' Drive function is also present within the Alcubierre Drive. 'Darkspace' is the earliest form of Hyperspace in which a higher dimension is breached in order to shorten travel times between locations. Darkspace describes the higher dimension which relatively equates to 1 lightyear in in our own dimension to be 2 795 894 404 km in Darkspace. The maximum Darkspace travel distance at once is 30 lightyears which is approximately 83 876 832 120 km in Darkspace.",

"Travelling 30 lightyears takes approximately just over 2 hours as the maximum Darkspace speed is approximately 96 780 960 138 km/E-h (Earth Hour) or 322826.5 lightseconds.",

"Darkspace is a relatively 'dark' alternate dimension and while used as a tunnel to breach through to other locations within our own dimensions, completely lacks any real valid scientific laws. Nothing exists within Darkspace and light does not exist. It's been confirmed by the disappearances of ships during the PSR_J0108-1431 Neutron Experiment that when a jump is interrupted, those still in Darkspace are subject to; as of current knowledge; the permanent state of suspension in another dimension.",

"Darkspace jumps are limited to 2 types of 'tunneling' modes. Mass and Beacon locks. Mass Locks are jumps with a minimum range of 1 lightyear and can only lock onto the highest mass celestial object within a star system. Magnetic forces of a solar system are enough to prevent any Darkspace jumps, including jumps that leave the system. Jump exit breaches typically range from 0.0001 to 0.0008 lightyears away from the absolute edge of the system.",

"Beacon locks are warp beacons that support both Darkspace and Hyperspace warp methods, provided that for Darkspace the beacon itself is of low magnetivity and outside the major magnetic influence of the system.",

"Due to planetary magnetic field fluctuations the possible areas for Darkspace jumps may severely vary during the Solar Year. This is currently the only method of exploring star systems directly as Hyperspace Warp Drives lack a mass-lock function and the Hypercruise functionality.",

"The Alcubierre Drive is able to be fitted in almost every ship and requires a minimum of a Combustion Engine for 5 lightyear jumps. Hydrogen or Nuclear Reactors are recommended however as they allow for the maximum 30 lightyear jumps of the Alcubierre Drive.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE NEUTRON STARS TO BOOST JUMP RANGE. THIS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF SHIP. SEE PROVIDED MANUAL FOR DETAILS."
