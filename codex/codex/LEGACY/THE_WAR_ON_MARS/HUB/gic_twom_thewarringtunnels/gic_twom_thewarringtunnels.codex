"The Warring Tunnels of Abercon

Well, I decided to be helpful this time. Mainly intended for my fellow Agents who walk these tunnels but also have no idea what resides in these tunnels. This should help keep you aware of the hazards these simple 'train tunnels' hold.",

"SOCIETY - Yes, societies live here. The Martian Humans back in the 2200s built these as defensive structures intended for the protection of billions of people. These 'train tunnels' are home to thousands of bunkers intended to house societies for more than 500 years. While their effectiveness in doing so is questionable, their location makes it nearly untouchable by 'legal' artillery. This practice in defensive military designs were later followed by future colonies built on other planets.",

"Each city contains a massive rail lines connecting to most major buildings (considering that the surface hasn't been habitable since the planet was created billions of years ago). Each city has a huge 'central' station where government bunkers are often speculated to be located at. As well as local city lines, huge train lines span all over across the planet, connecting every city to eachother. The Martians were smart to keep most of their operations 'underground'.",

"I have no reason to believe that said lines between some cities still even exist as the relative peacetime on Mars reinstated spaceships as the 'norm' mode of transport but it's still clear that each city is a vast network of train tunnels and bunkers. One might even say that the surface buildings are nothing more than mere observation posts.",


"FACTIONS - The juicy stuff. I haven't been able to get radio contact from the other cities. Not even the closest which is Leeds but it's inevitable for factions to pop up. Commies, Nazis, Cultists... Can be anything really.",

"Metromacht - The first interplanetary faction ever since Mars was blockaded since the planet was engaged in war. Remnants of the Martian Unity Federation, these Nazis face resent and extreme anguish towards the loss of their 'rightful' planet and attempt to 'purify' Mars from the 'mutants' allegedly caused by the radiation from the surface detonations leaking into the metro.",

"Red Line - The second interplanetary faction. These are communists who hold an iron grip on their part of Martian territory. While not as high-tech as the Metromacht, they make up for in extremely high numbers. There's atleast a billion of these guys still alive.",

  
"Maybe these papers will be of use to someone. The bastard Loyalists rejected my simple request for a computer, a printer and just a goddamn generator. Noooope I had to scrounge up and barter half of my military equipment for just the generator."
