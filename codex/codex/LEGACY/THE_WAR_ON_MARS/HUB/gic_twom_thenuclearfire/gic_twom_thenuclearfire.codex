"800 years ago, us humans once dreamt of going to Mars. We wrote books, created plays and even broadcasted the stories of what Mars could hold over Earthern Radio... But, I guess we were innocent back then. Not many people bother to learn Ancient History, but I did. Shockingly, the dreams of Martian Colonization prior to the invention of Dimensional Breaching were on much more 'peaceful' terms than the window-less metre-thick concrete walls and thin layer of metal walls that surround us on Mars today.",

"Huge domed structures with habitats recreating the life on Earth. Inflatable self-containing units. Countries working together for scientific purposes yet... We have none of that now...",


"Even after the onset of World War 3 during the late 21st Century, it would only take a mere 200 years of a slow recovery from the ashes of nuclear fire for us to yet again destroy another planet. Earth had already been ravaged. The colonization of Mars had already begun, but no plans were made for domed structures or utopian standards. Huge towers of concrete became the dominant figurehead of the future of space colonization. People lived not with plants or animals, but with machinery and weapons.",

"Train tunnels connected to buildings across these towering concrete cities, forming the main logistical movement of industry for Mars. Spaceships? That was a rare sight unless you were going off-world. When the time had come, the Martian colonies rebelled against their Earthern Colonizers leading to the first interplanetary war between the Earth Administration Alliance and the newly-formed Martian Unity Federation.",

"Their concrete towers: Undamaged by Early Orbital Kinetics. The underground train system: Impervious to the effects of constant nuclear bombardment. They planned it for 30 years for both efficiency and survivability. While the superior forces of Earth did win, the Martians had held their territories for nearly 20 years. Once the Unity Federation collapsed, so did the Administration Alliance over the consequent disputes over colony ownership. Yet again, humanity warred with itself.",

"Here Mars lays, forever destroyed. No more hope for terraforming. The surface is just chock-full of radiation which seeps into the train tunnels.",


"Every planet colonized had problems with independence. Whether they got it depended on the colonizer."
