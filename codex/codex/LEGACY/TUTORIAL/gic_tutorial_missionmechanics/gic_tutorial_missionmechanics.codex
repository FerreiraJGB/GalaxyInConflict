Ok, to start off this is a direct message from the developers of US.E.",

"Now to clear up a major misconception, Leeds City IS NOT the only campaign of US.E. To explain, each campaign is finished via a 'trophy' at the end of said missions. These trophies MUST BE INTERACTED WITH TO FINISH THE MISSION QUEST, THEN   -INTERACTED WITH AGAIN-   TO START A NEW QUEST TO TALK TO THE NEXT MISSION OPERATOR. This has been a commonly overlooked part, with many players interacting once to finish the quest but overlooking the 'new quest' popup on the trophy.",

"Missions in US.E are also divided into 2 categories: 'Campaigns' and 'Non-replayable'. Campaigns act similarly to standard vanilla missions but are extremely long and are often filled with large amounts of combat. Some have multiple branching paths. Non-Replayables are shorter missions that cannot be replayed and are often smaller filler missions to indicate a time gap."
