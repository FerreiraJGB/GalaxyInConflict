"[TUTORIAL: SUIT MECHANICS]

Space Suits in the main storyline of US.E play an integral part in keeping you alive on the Martian Surface. Without it you'll slowly take damage, eventually killing you. You will need the entire full suit which consists of: the Back, Head, Chest and Legs.",

"US.E's Space Suits lack the HP and Energy Boosts of normal armors. Special 'Modules' can be found throughout the main storyline which can help alleviate the issues of the surface by (re-)increasing your energy and HP to more tolerable levels.",

"A basic 'Armor Plate' is given to you for free which will add enough Defense Value to match Tier 6 armor."
