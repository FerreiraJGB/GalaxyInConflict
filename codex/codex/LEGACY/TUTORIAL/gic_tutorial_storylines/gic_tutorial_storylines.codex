"[TUTORIAL: STORYLINES]

The Operations Table in US.E is the main table in which storylines and other various side-missions are started from. The following pages contain summaries on the available options. All missions are designed for Tier 6 only ----- I will personally be disappointed if you use anything above Tier 6. :(",


"'Legacy' STORYLINE (Loyalist Recruitment)

This is the current 'active' storyline for US.E. There are 4 campaigns each lasting 2 hours (shorter if you use equipment higher than Tier 6). You take the role of a Loyalist Soldier, defeating Rebel Unitans on Terraformed Mars.",


"'Battle For Mars' STORYLINE [WIP]

This is the upcoming story rewrite for US.E. In this timeline Mars was never terraformed and much of their society revolves around underground bunkers connected by Metro Tunnels and Pressurized Trains. It is currently under development. Early access can be granted with the tutorial map id: 'gic_twom_ch0_1'.",


"'Fantesar' ARENA

A small experimental arena with 3 full-on anime-like bosses. Originally a joke for the co-devs I ended up getting serious with their bullet-hell attacks and extreme speed.",


"'Annual Events' ARENA

I'll be honest I've only made the halloween special event which is a simple bullet-hell concept mission. Everything else I seriously can't be bothered pumping out missions for. Soz.",


"'Luftbrenner' MINIGAME

A proof-of-concept map made extremely early during US.E's early days (pre-1.3) to test the viability of air-combat missions. The sprites haven't changed and are thus still horrid to look at. Mechanically it's ok I guess."
