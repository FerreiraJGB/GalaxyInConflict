"The 'United Systems Model' or simply 'USM' is a United Systems Official Government Arms Race issuing a new generation of multipurpose rifles based on 20th and 21st Century American Rifles, in order to replace the 2427 Secession Period of outdated 'Pulse Rifles'.

The first, the USM-16 was based on the M16 internally and the M14 externally. Designed for light patrol operations in harsh atmospheric conditions prior to the 2655 Floran Invasion.",

"The Floran Invasion of 2655-2659 eventually lead to the mid-war creation of the USM-4 platform, entirely based on the M4 AR Platform. It proved to be far superior in terms of firepower but reliability in harsh jungle terrains which were often the common guerilla conflict zones for the Florans, suffered heavily.",

"2817 came to the beginnings of a revival of older times. The discovery of Abandoned Red Star Alliance sites and having been Allied in the past came the USM-47E, based on the AKE-47 Energy Rifle. While a 'cheap knockoff' to many, this rifle according to the original designer is ''a tribute to the people that have suffered to ensure we pass their legacy on''.",

"This Energy Rifle is mechanically very similar to the AKE-47 but with the addition of a magazine with multiple mini-batteries which also act as ejectable heatsinks instead of the single battery magazine that heavily rely on the transfer of heat to the outside of the gun."
