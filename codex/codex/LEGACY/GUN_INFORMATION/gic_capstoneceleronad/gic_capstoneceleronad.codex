The Celeron Assault Rifle is an Assault Rifle developed by Capstone's weapons manufacturing division to compete with, at the time, M4A56 Rifles which quickly became outdated once Capstone moved all of their assets off-Earth. Capstone's Engineers began to conceptualize and eventually prototype the Capstone YM-32. The first 10 prototypes were a complete failure as the main barrel failed to properly dissipate heat.",

"With each prototype Capstone's Engineers experimented with different materials and compositions for the YM-32 prototypes. The final prototyped YM-32 named the ''YM-32 Mod.1'' was accepted and revised as the ''MK32 Celeron''. The Celeron is made of carbon and polymer with its components being constructed out of titanium. The barrel is constructed with an outer carbon layer and an internal titanium compound with hexagonal rifling for the old-Earth 5.56x45mm NATO.",

"The barrel was revised to have holes to vent the gas and heat, overall reducing the recoil alongside its lightweight base. The Celeron is typically produced with an adjustable stock. Common features include upper picatinny rail mounts, foldable tritium sights and screw mounts on the side of the rifle for additional attachments of rail mounts. An M405 launcher can be mounted under the rail which snaps onto the handguard. Screw mounts allow the launcher to be attached to the gun for additional stability",

"Additional attachments specifically for the Mk32 Celeron have been produced including a combined holosight that can also function as a grenade sight specifically for the Celeron Rifle.

The Celeron Rifle has a maximum firerate of 600 RPM and has a maximum effective range of 850 metres."
