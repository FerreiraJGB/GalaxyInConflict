"The origins of the Kalash are actually incredibly murky, as it refers to the hundreds of variations of the infamously popular AK platform.

One certain variation however, has become a staple of knockoff AK rifles. The Kalash 'Identifiable Mass-Produced Variant 84' or simply, Kalash-84 is a concurrently noticeable trend in the AK bootleg family. Approximately 80% of confiscated weaponry from illegal weapons factories have been Kalash-84s.",

"The Kalash-84 is mechanically similar to the AK-47, rather than the updated AKM-15 or modern AK-60 rifle. This mechanical design choice can be attributed to a lack of high-grade weapon parts. It has been noted that it's possible to convert a Bastard Gun into a Kalash-84."
