"The Eagle Rifle was the first proposed idea by an external Arms Manufacturer known as 'The Citizens Arms' for a singular multipurpose gun, similar to the dumped USM-4 Rifle. Sporting 9Ã—45mm ammunition, its main selling point was its high power and sufficiently rapid firerate as an all-purpose rifle. The United Systems eventually accepted the contract for production and began use during 2503 to quell moderate dissenters and small splinter military groups.",

"Its stopping power proved to be highly valuable against many splinter groups who relied on heavy ballistic protection but the gun itself weighed 6kg, which became tiring for soldiers to carry and the magazine capacity wasn't as favorable as many expected. The Eagle Rifle was eventually dropped only a year later, reverting the standard issue back towards the USM-16."
