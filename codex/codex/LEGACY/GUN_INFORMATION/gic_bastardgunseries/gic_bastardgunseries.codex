"The 'Bastard' Series is a streamlined modernization of the improvised firearms constructed after the Third World War in the Metro Tunnels of a Nuclear Russia in the late 21st Century. Despite its conception as improvisation during apocalyptic conditions and overall shoddy general construction, it remains a staple firearm often taught to many military-orientated societies, notably in the United Systems as part of a standardized engineering education curriculum.",

"The original design is often credited to Abzny Strelik, a former Moscow Metro Rail Engineer who was at the time, tasked with smithing new rails to replace the damaged rails of the Lubyanka Station. Their surviving neighbouring station of the Chistye Prudy happened to be occupied by a group of Bandits. Their target was Lubyanka Station which housed many surviving Russian Federation Politicians and high-ranking members of the Government.",

"2099, October 2nd. Abzny Strelik had been working on an improvised firearm, which had interested some Government Members and his fellow Engineers. On October 7th, when a 4-man group of Chiste Station Bandits conducted a raid against Abzny's Storage Shelter. The Gun proved to be a valuable assistant to the firepower of the AK-60s despite the barrel having fell off halfway through the battle and the gravity-fed exposed magazine disassembling infront of Federation Soldiers.",

"In the end, Abzny's design was able to be easily replicated due to its improvised nature. His design became the first in the Metro to be easily mass-produced, making the Lubyanka Station the first to produce firearms.

Abzny Strelik died on the August 26th 2078 at the age of 31 from Lung Cancer after excessive exposure to nuclear fallout attempting to replace the surface Metro tracks to connect it to nearby active surviving industry."
