"UNITED SYSTEMS DIVISIONS

The Modern United Systems are split into two active-duty military divisions, each with a specialized role and varying amounts of funding.",

"The Space Infantry Units are the standard issue soldiers, being stationed everywhere in the lonely, harsh environments of space. While lacking the self-sustainability of the Ancient Earthern Atmospheric Soldiers of carrying their own rations and such, they make up for in their outright ability to maneuveur and operate an the environment of space.",

"The Expeditionary Force Soldier carries 54 kilograms worth of equipment into battle which contain items such as sleeping bags, rations, tools and possibly other more advanced equipment such as Nightvision Goggles or even FLIR. These soldiers are purely deployed on planets habitable to humans and as such are not as common nor do they require the training of spacesuit usage. Due to their more vague purposes, they are less common."
