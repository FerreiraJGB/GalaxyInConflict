"The planet you are currently residing on is undergoing a rapid shift in the local climate, resulting in a mass planetary drop in temperature which may reach as low as 200 Kelvin. Do not lose hope, there is still external rescue efforts underway. Supply Drops are being sent to populated areas across the planet and fossil-fuel powered Steam Hubs will be dropped into areas marked by supply drops and automatically deployed to provide warmth."
