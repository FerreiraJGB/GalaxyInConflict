"As we further ourselves into the stars we may find hardships along the way. Hostile aliens whose sole purpose is to wipe us. We must gain control over these savage minds and pacify them via any means possible to join our cause to spread the word of peace throughout the stars. We spread this peace and we may be on the path of reconcillation. If we don't, our fragmented wars will continue. We must gain the support of those that would seek to originally destroy us."
