"People believe us to be extinct because of Earth. They think that we would rather lay down and die.

We are alive. We are hundreds of billions strong. We stand stronger, more than ever. Systems once independent are choosing sides against the colossal tidal wave known as the Protectorate.",

"We have colonized a large amount of star systems in a sphere of influence 100 LY in Sol as well as outside of the Core Systems, which include us: The United Systems. Where our once similar ally of the Red Star Alliance fell, we will take the torch and hold it ever higher to spark once again that humanity will never fall. We will never die and we will leave behind for future generations more than a wartorn galaxy we are in, for we are the bringers of a new age.",

"They'll think we're endangered. Thanks to the Protectorate's lying and manipulation of information every other species, the lesser humans without communications have become indoctrinated to hold the belief humanity is going extinct. Preying on the lesser intelligent they garner followers to so-called 'unify' humanity where they have only brought death and destruction of billions of lives.",

"We will prove them wrong. We will destroy the Protectorate to every last trace until the hundreds of billions of lives may rest easy knowing that their next day they'll wake up not annexed by the Protectorate nor their homes destroyed from mere rejection of annexation.

We are still alive, yet left abandoned by those that truly believe we are nearly extinct. Let it be known that we will not go down without a fight.",

"Peace to the Fallen and may God forgive us all."
