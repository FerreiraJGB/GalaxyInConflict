"We are the final bastion of hope for humanity. The Core Systems are in anarchy. Billions are dead from the Unification War and billions more have been displaced from their homes and their families. It is now our duty to shelter those affected by the people who have led us to destruction. It is now our duty as people of the United Systems to defend the last hopes of humanity against those that would seek to enslave and destroy us. We will expand outwards, forming defensive territories for humanity.",

"The Protectorate remain, ever-lasting and ever-hungering for power. It is now our utmost responsibility that we prevent another Unification War. The only method: extermination; annihilate every remaining trace of the Protectorate before they finish us off. They will keep beating us, destroying our cultures and our humanity until we root them out and exterminate every single one of them!",

"Our very ancestry has been formed as the defense force of a nation! Now we must take that responsibility as that nation to stop the Protectorate!

Humanity must survive!"
