"The Wormhole Warp Drive is exactly as it is implies. It's a type of Warp Drive that rips through our own dimension directly and opens up a portal to another space. In the most simple and basic terms; it opens a portal for physical objects to pass through. This as of this book's publication, is an a state of extreme prototype testing and only recently revealed to the public by leaked USCM documents.",

"Public information is limited to what governments allow for information on Wormhole research but current available releases of information promises it as the 'future' of modern warp drives. No further information on the Wormhole Drives is available."
