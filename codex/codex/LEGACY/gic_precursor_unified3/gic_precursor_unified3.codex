"As the people of the Protectorate, it is our sworn duty to serve our rightful duty of keeping Galactic peace. We have signed many non-aggression pacts with other galaxy-spanning races who have declared that they want to avoid a war with us. We have already integrated many lesser beings for our cause, beings who we have uplifted with our next-generation tech. With the support of new people, our cause is more just than ever. Our cause to spread peace is soon upon the Galaxy and we will end tyranny once and for all."
