"I have spent most of my life as a Protectorate Citizen. I have recently seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us are greater than political party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this galaxy are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, ''We've never had it so good.''",

"As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the human wife, mother, or father whose spouse, son, or daughter has died in the occupation of foreign territories, and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they mean peace, or do they mean that we just want to be left in peace? There can be no real peace while one Human is dying some place in the galaxy for ungrateful xenos living in luxury.",

"We're in an invisible war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. And it's been said that if we lose that war, and our freedom, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least. Well, I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know our birthrights, as set by the first colonizers on Mars. They are our founding people, more so than the xenophile sycophants that remain on Earth.",

"We have endured a nagging, unnecessary imposition: to choose between a left or right, a Free Republic or a Military Dictatorship. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down. Upward toward man's ancient birthright, and the ultimate individual freedom consistent with law and order. Or downward into the ant heap of xeno totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, or even their motives, those who trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.",

"We have so many people who can't see a human standing beside a xeno without coming to the conclusion the human got that way by taking advantage of the xeno. So they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning, outside of human control. Well, now, if external xeno government planning and surveillance of the state was the answer (and they've had almost 40 years of it), shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while?",

"Shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help on planets stricken by war? The reduction in the need for public housing in foreign territories? They don't, because it all backfired: Each year the needs grow greater; the xeno influence similarly grows greater. We were told 2 years ago by whistleblowers that 50 billion people went to bed hungry each night under the watchful eye of the Protectorate. And the Protectorate's response was: ''They are not yet our people.''",

"Who are they actually helping then? Not too long ago, a Junior Protector called me to Great Britain. He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. She had 2 children, and was pregnant with her 3rd. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer with no pay, trapped on a Wartorn world a mere 20 lightyears from Earth, denied a chance to leave not because of his nation,",

"but because of the Protectorate occupation that decreed no terrestrial nation could engage in space travel until the world was unified in a post-scarcity utopia like Earth. Their plan for peace isn't to fix the problem, but to simply contain it. There never was a peace program, or an initiative to bring populations above the poverty line. Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals.",

"They say that we're, ''always ''against'' things; We're never ''for'' anything.'' Well, the trouble with our Protector friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.",

"Our Protectorate opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between no one, and that we're to choose only one correct answer. As a former citizen of the so-called Protectorate, I beg of those few remaining to resist, to reject xeno influences, and to denounce the very idea of submission."
