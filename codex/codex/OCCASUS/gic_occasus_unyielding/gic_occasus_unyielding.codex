"Why do you continue to fight? The role of a Planetary Defense Force, Global Military or to others as 'Federals': the defense of a planet from foreign or otherwise external threats outside the control of the collective planetary power.

Yet oddly enough, you continue to fight for noone. Nobody except for measly payments setup by xeno influencers, digging into your minds and promising you lies.",

"You are a fighting force primarily consisting of humans, and maybe the odd xeno who cares little of their origins. There is no use in fighting this pointless war.

The Protectorate is not human-controlled, but influenced by Xeno Elites, an open secret state known as the Galactic Community by which they plan to neuter us until we are pacifist to a point of total obedience.",

"Refusal to surrender is a refusal to accept the truth, and control of as many planets for the Occasus cause is necessary to retaliate against the Protectyrannists. Objections to the cause leaves no path but the complete annihilation of the Planetary Government for total reconstruction of this society, total annihilation of those that support the Protectorate. Lay down your arms for your slavers and instead fight with us as freedom fighters; as fighters for national freedom.",
