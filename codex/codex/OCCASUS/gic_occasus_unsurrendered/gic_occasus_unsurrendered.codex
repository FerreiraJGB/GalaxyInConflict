"Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the xeno welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy ''accommodation.'' And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the xeno enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems.",

"Well, perhaps there is a simple answer - not an easy answer but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right. We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Blue Curtain,",

"''Give up your dreams of freedom in the stars because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters.'' An unknown historical figure once said, ''A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.'' Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war,",

"but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender. Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning Protector friends refuse to face, that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender.",

"If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Big Ape has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Galactic Community, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically.",

"He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for ''peace at any price'' or ''better Blue than Bled,'' or as one commentator put it, he'd rather ''live on his knees than die on his feet.'' And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.",

"If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this influence? Or should the Earthern Federation have told the children of Earth to live in darkness under a nuclear sky? Should Christ have refused the Cross? Should the patriots at Unita have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round humanity? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Xenos didn't die in vain.",

"Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all. You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, ''There is a price we will not pay.'' ''There is a point beyond which they must not advance.'' And this - this is the meaning in the phrase of our founding colonizer's ''peace through strength.'' ''The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals.''",

"There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty. You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man in this Galaxy, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a million years of darkness."
