"When the Protectorate began its occupation of the human core worlds, where do you think they got their power? It was never a signed agreement between once-powerful nations that forged our path to the stars, but a coaxing and coralling of humanity by xeno forces to stem our growth, to cut us out from within. Under their guise, they would lead us to believe that we are mere fools, that we would simply accept to live and die in coophouses we would normally call home.",

"The Xeno Elite, the Galactic Community, the ever-loving peacekeepers as they would define themselves as have sought to their interests to have our very spirit ripped from our souls to trap us onto one place, one planet with only one goal: death in a hospital bed, accelerated by the Xeno. They did not convince the core worlds to become amalgamated into the Protectorate so much they held their collective weapons from within and were told to sign, or starve.",

"No matter the Xeno's reach, the majority of humanity refused to surrender itself into the Protectorate, a term that the Alien themselves have foolishly accepted. A protectorate is a nation under rule of another, paying taxes to their overlords. It is an open secret the Protectorate are not the words of humans, but the alien, the elites of the Xeno who seek to pamper us to the point of moral, ethical and spiritual reduction of the self.",

"Their pampering, their attempt at material desires to keep us in one place to die in one place is an open trap to prevent our claim to the stars; an attempt because they wouldn't dare fight humanity in its truest forms. Exploiting the weak of humanity, they would dare hope their Protectorate goons would rat us out before we rise from the ashes of sealed Wartorn worlds, from the bones of so-called Federal forces paid by the Xeno Elite.",

"Perhaps ever more, why has no human media ever left the human core worlds? No trade. no people, nothing. It's no lie that this is the very beginning of totalitarianism and the subjugation of our cultural homeworlds. Those that seek pride in their existence, those that would whistle in a void without care for their own life reveal life behind a false blue sky. Policies and indoctrination of the Core Worlds, every planet repeating the same message over and over.",

"''Love the alien.'' ''Xeno tolerance is a virtue of life.'' ''Our benefactors: The Xeno.'' are but a few of the millions of indoctrination campaigns within the Core Worlds used to subjugate humanity. Media: wiped of human creativity and genius, but replaced with the feats of Xenos; the talents of the alien. Humanity's core force-fed the superiority of the Alien and the people just watch, unknowing of their fate should they continue to walk that fated path alone.",

"Anything that would even dare imply the talents of humanity; snuffed. The colonization of Mars is banned. Our first warp ships, erased from the databanks of Core World history. Merely speaking of humanity's great survival of the World War 3 Nuclear Holocaust is punishable by a Protector: jacked on nanobots and with an intent to silence any form of dissent in the vague form of a human. Wretched, twisted and tortured in their minds to obey the Alien. The alien act, still makes one an alien.",

"Any discussion on humanity's achievements are taped over with the achievements of Xeno benefactors; drilling into the citizens of those worlds of how they should praise their Alien overlords. Anything sacred to human culture is smashed, destroyed and erased until the generations after ours have forgotten who we are. That is their fated path if we do not intervene, if we do not annihilate the Protectorate: An entire generation of humanity, pacified into submission.",

"This is their plan. A force of the entire Galactic Community, every single known alien united in an effort to merely stunt humanity from achieving its old-aged dream since the first civilizations of humanity rose out of the jungles. To stop us, to contain us on worlds no matter if your material desires are met or if you're unable to scrape water out of the sand. It never did matter to them, for we are vermin to them; a pest to be contained. We will show them what it means to be human.",

"We are the Occasus. We are the setting of the sun. We will bring Death to those that would attempt to bring humanity to its Downfall. We will die standing in the Ruins of the alien who sought to neuter us.

We are the Occasus, and we are the Setting of the dusts in the wind. We will bring Destruction to humanity's enemies."
