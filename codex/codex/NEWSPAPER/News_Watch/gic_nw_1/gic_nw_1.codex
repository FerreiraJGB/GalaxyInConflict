NEWSWATCH: The man, the destroyer of lies, Paul Truinet.",

"ALLIANCE OF INDEPENDENTS' EXPANSIVE OPTIMISM

So yes the Alliance of Independents is plotting their 600 trillion credit construction plan along the human sphere of influence but is it seriously worth it? Well possibly yes if it means drawing in only the small miniscule cost of a 200 billion credit debt. What, a, whopper.",

"Truly it isn't worth the cost yet the Alliance insists it is for the good of mankind. Or is it? What is for the good of mankind anyways when it plunges your own nation into a national crisis debt. Some optimists say they'll just loan off the debt money to the United Systems. Of course, the critics know that you can't just print more money. Well, nobody knows for sure as the Alliance has kept their financial plans a secret."
