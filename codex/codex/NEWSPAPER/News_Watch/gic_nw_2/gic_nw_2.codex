NEWSWATCH: The man, the destroyer of lies, Paul Truinet.",

"UNRESTRICTED TRADE EXPANSE

This is Paul Truinet with another story from NewsWatch. A source still more reliable than any megacorp out there. Today's story is a similar one from a few days ago. The continuing developments on the Alliance of Independent Station's decision to tackle an expansion project has been fully approved following some new details on unrestricted trade agreements with the Cooperative Merchant Territories and the Unitans.",

"Supposed 'top' analysts predict that the nation's GDP will increase by 0.4%, a piece of bollocks that the Galactic Liberal Coalition believe. On another front is the Workers Cosmic Front, angry that there will be less reliance on their already mining-centric space economy. Overall many prefer working civic services export rather than the hostile environments of space mining. Consequently, such free trade has brought in the question of what goods are legal.",

"It's well known that cybernetic augments and synths are banned in the United Systems, but such commodities are unrestricted in the Alliance. Perhaps a new market will affect the populace's opinion in all 3 parties. In more minor news there have been minor military tensions between the Alliance and the Protectorate. Perhaps those materials would look good for the Protectorate to make more of their mindless drones."
