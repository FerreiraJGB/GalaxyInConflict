NEWSWATCH: The man, the destroyer of lies, Paul Truinet.",

"ENGAGEMENT OF PROXIES

On today's story is the 'shocking' new developments on the United Systems who have publicly declared their position on shipping arms to the Avians who call themselves the 'Grounded'. It's almost like they're trying to take the piss out of the current unified theocratic state of the Avian Stargazers who are already unhappy enough as it is with those 'pesky non-suicidal humans'.",

"Maybe it's thanks to that one time they tried to start a war over a few human criminals. While it definitely is an act of proxy warfare the United Systems hasn't done anything else but assist in the supply of weapons to the 'Grounded'. This means that both ends of this 'Science vs Religion' conflict are still absolutely atrocious at any basic semblance of warfare. The Unitans aren't making money off this indirect act of war either.",

"Military-wise it seems that they're waiting until the Avian territories 'soften up' to say. Soldier-wise it does generate a plethora of incompetent combat footage for the galaxy to see. On the citizen-wise thoughts is the minor Unitan protesting on homeland security facing a potential 'weapon shortage' of AKM-15s. On the subject of Unitans: A big ban on Avian religious structures. Hoo boy. The Unitan Administration deemed the Stargazer religion as 'Fanatic' and 'evocative of terrorism'.",

"How true this is is yet to actually be seen but as comes the sudden rapid change as to 'who' the enemy is comes the stricter border patrols. So strict that Avians under the 'Stargazer' religion have been outright deported and new influxes straight denied by the United Systems. That's xenophobic, but so is the Protectorate whose ego has them still screaming about 'equality' and 'justice' only when it serves them an upper ground.",

"Ironically the Protectorate who denounce such 'horrible Unitans' treat Avians under an intense welfare system which has left a substantial part of their labor force unhappy. Rightfully so.

This has been Paul Truinet of NewsWatch, out."
