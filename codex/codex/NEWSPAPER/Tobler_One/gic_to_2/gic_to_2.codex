"ALLIANCE OF TRADE

In an effort to repay the costs of the expansion project the Alliance of Independents has announced that they will allow unrestricted trade in an agreement with the Cooperative Merchant Territories as well as including the United Systems in this agreement. This agreement will allow the AoI to import manufacturing and construction materials at a lower cost in exchange for their existing exports of luxury items and civic services.",

"This agreement is expected to increase the GDP of the AoI by 0.4% was put forth by the Galactic Liberal Coalition party. The Workers Cosmic Front is opposed to this agreement even with the expected benefits of the open borders, saying that it has 'increased the AoI's reliance on other factions' and that it will 'reduce export revenue' even with the lower manufacturing costs.",

"There has been some minor border tension between the Cooperative Merchant Territories raising the point that illegal goods may be transported between the three factions using this system. The United Systems has refused to comment and the Alliance has tried to alleviate these concerns commenting that ''all imports will be checked for illicit goods''.",

"In response to this agreement a Protectorate paramilitary group known as the ‘PSF’ has increased troop numbers near the borders of the United Systems and the Cooperative Merchants, taking several United Systems manufacturing colonies along the borders of their territory. We may see increased combat near the borders due to this agreement and the already tenuous relations between the Eve-4 Cooperative and the Protectorate may dissolve into yet another war."
