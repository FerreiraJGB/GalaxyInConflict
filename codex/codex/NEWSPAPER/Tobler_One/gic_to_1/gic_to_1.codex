"ALLIANCE OF INDEPENDENTS TO BEGIN MASS COLONIZATION

I recently came into contact with a traveler who said he was from the far reaches. As most people know, the far reaches are unpatrolled, lawless, and dangerous with most planets being uninhabitable or unstable. When i asked him which planet he came from the traveler said that he was from a new colony on a volcanic moon established by the Alliance of Independents.",

"During a meeting with one of the commanders of an Alliance station he said that the Alliance of Independents has begun a massive project to expand upon the borders of humanity, building many new stations along the far reaches and constructing colonies on previously thought uninhabitable planets. These colonies are reported to be numerous and new, with advanced technology being used to stabilize the planets and protect the colonists.",

"I asked about the cost of this project the head engineer told me that estimates place the cost at about 600 trillion credits, draining the AoI coffers and plunging them into debt. One question remains; Will the vast resources in the far reaches be enough to pay off the debt? Or will the Alliance crumble under the cost?"
