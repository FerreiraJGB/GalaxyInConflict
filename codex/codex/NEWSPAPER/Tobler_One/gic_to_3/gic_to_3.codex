"PROXIES IN WARFARE

The Protectorate have condemned the United Systems after the United Systems announced that they will begin a supply chain to fund the Grounded Avians. The Protectorate have claimed that these 'Grounded' Avians are 'terrorists' and that they will attack civilians.

The United Systems announced a plan to create supply chains in order to 'fund' the Grounded Avians against the Theocratic Avians. The Unitans have also banned the construction of new Avian temples in their space and have begun to demolish existing temples, enraging the Theocratic Avians. Protestors have gathered against the demolition of the temples with some even climbing and sitting on the roof or chaining themselves to pillars until they are knocked out and dragged away.",

"These actions have further angered the Protectorate who commented saying ''The United Systems have no right in the religious affairs of other races, to impose their rule on the Avians is oppressive''. A Unitan Senator scoffed at the remark, calling it 'double standards': 'You so-called Protectors have no right in forcing anyone else what they shall think or do with their lives while you sit inside a mansion, letting the drones do the work for you.'",

"Minor conflicts in Avian space have sporadically happened, and to allay fears of an attack from the Theocratic Avians there has been a massive increase in troops around the Unitan/Avian border, an all out war is more than likely with the Unitan population mocking the Theocratic Avians for their religion.",

"Other factions disapprove of the United Systems course of action with the Alliance of Independent Systems chairman claiming ''The Grounded Avians will become the next terrorists and will attack everyone in reach''. The Cooperative Merchant Territories refused to elaborate on the matter.",

"In response to this move by the US, the AoI have imposed tariffs on weapons manufactured by the US, especially the AKM, which has become the main weapon used by the Grounded and have imposed a higher minimum price for weapons parts and materials exports. Many are heralding this move as 'damaging' as the Unitans are not above using military force to seize resources 'directly' if it means avoiding the tariff."
