DIEGO RIVERA: The rivers a-flowin'!",

"GROUNDED TO SHELTER

In response to the statement made less than an hour ago on United Systems refusal to harbor Avian refugees, officials of both the Liberal and Labor Parties, as well as commanders of the United Citizens Militia, have given their own statements on the matter. Jeffrey Mulligan, the Campaign Manager of the Liberal Party, gave his opinion of it all on the social network Wasser.",

"''Right now, our government seems to be forgetting the core values of our nation,'' he wrote. ''The mass-demolition of Stargazer places of worship was a huge contrast to our ideology of religious tolerance, and the mass-deportation of Stargazer citizens - 98% of whom had committed no crimes and were legal, law-abiding, friendly and productive citizens - accomplished nothing but showing the galactic community that we cannot keep our ancient promises to our own people.",

"And now ships of starving, wounded refugees from the side that our government CHOSE TO SUPPORT are being forced to turn back from US Space, in which they hoped to find salvation. This act can, and must, be revoked. Thousands of innocent lives are at stake.''",

"Chief Organizer for the Labor Party, Gerald R. Howell, and United Citizens Militia Col. Edmund Ross, have spoken before the public on the plan that they have formulated to deal with the refugee crisis. ''There are thousands of unexplored star systems, many of which may be inhabitable.",

"Already we have a naval presence in the gentle star system Nebulon Prime, and there is an uninhabited 'garden planet' which our researchers have determined to be habitable by all known intelligent species. With government and public funding, we could set up several shelters for the refugees on this world, without them even entering U.S. territory.''",

"The Labor Party and UCM Officials plan to meet with the Secretary of Commerce to discuss this plan and the possibility of government funding. In the meantime, both parties are holding a fundraiser, which you can donate to on both their websites. More information as it becomes available. This is Diego Rivera signing off."
