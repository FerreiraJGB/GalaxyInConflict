DRAKE ATKINS: Rake the good news first!",

"A GAZE TO THE STARS

United Systems officials indirectly declare war on the Avian unified theocracy organization, The Stargazers.",

"The US has pledged to assist the Avain resistance, known as the 'Grounded'. Supply chains of firearms, ammunition, and medkits have been opened, fueling the Grounded with the much-desired supplies. One Avian Grounded thanks the US: ''These weapons and supplies are tremendously appreciated! Thanks to the United Systems, we the Grounded can finally strike back at the Stargazers. Too long have they oppressed us with the chains of their religious terror! We the Grounded will stand tall and fly high on our OWN wings!''",

"In addition, the United Systems have placed more military units on the boundaries of Stargazer controlled space, ready to intervene in the increased violence. While the United Systems will provide weapons and supplies to Grounded revolutionaries, they will not provide sanctuary for all Avian refugees. The increased conflict in Avian space has forced many Avian civilians to flee as refugees. Many thought that the US would take them in due to their militaristic support.",

"However, the US is flatly denying sanctuary to any who do not follow the immigration process to enter their territory. ''We hate those Stargazer fanatic scum as much as anyone else,'' says a US official, ''but that does not mean that we can afford to harbor all those fleeing from their homes. Avians must follow the procedures and fill out the paperwork to enter our borders. Otherwise, there is plenty of space in the galaxy away from the Stargazers.''",

"Remember, you heard it here from Drake Atkins! Stay safe out there!"
