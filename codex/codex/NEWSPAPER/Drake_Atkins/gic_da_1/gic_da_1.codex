DRAKE ATKINS: Rake the good news first!",

"A GALACTIC DISGRUNTLEMENT

Disgruntled mining workers from the WCF (Workers Cosmic Front) Labor Party begin protests against the unrestricted trade agreement of the Alliance of Independents with the Eve-4 Cooperative and the United Systems. Workers worry they will lose jobs en masse as the demand for ore and refined metals decrease in the face of increasing demand for luxury goods and services.",

"Protests are expected to increase in frequency and severity as time goes on. One of these protesting workers is quoted: 'We have families! We need these jobs! Why the hell do LUXURIES take priority over us!?' Tensions rise between the WCF Labor Party and the Galactic Liberal Coalition who stand on opposite ends of this debate.",

"A representative from the GLC has been quoted: 'While mining is indeed important to the galactic economy, our consumers need the comfort our luxury products provide in this time of conflict and hate.' In other news, the Cooperative Merchant Territories and United Systems have seen a rise in smugglers and illegal goods since the unrestricted trade agreement was signed.",

"Action was requested to deal with the sudden increase of crime, however the galactic conflict severely limits the number of enforcers, as they are away in combat.

You heard it here from Drake Atkins!"
