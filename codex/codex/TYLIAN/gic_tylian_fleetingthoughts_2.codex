"[1] Ugh, bloody hell, where-

[2] Sit still you dog. You're lucky to have survived the initial drop. Most men don't, and-

[1] Am I in some fuckin' dream? Bloody women and sunlight, the hell is this bollocks.

[2] You want to shut up or what? No, you're not dreaming.

[1] Uogh it's just like some fuckin' isekai or what they call it.",

[2] That's natural for some survivors. I can't tell you everything yet, but go make yourself a part of the village. There's never a shortage for humans like you.",




"[1] Tylian... My name's Tylian.
