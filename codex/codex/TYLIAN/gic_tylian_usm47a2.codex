"A few weeks ago, a small band of roving Lunarians haggling at the Bazaar told us of unnatural geological patterns found on Ross 1047 B 1 A, a semi-colonized system mostly inhabited by humans and a small demographic of youkai. Upon planetfall at the location, a small industrial colony was found at the expected coordinates. Noting here that the lunarians only mentioned unnatural geological patterns, not an in-tact colony.",

"The expeditionary found many items of mostly unremarkable make. While the location is potentially anomalous, only a handful of small artifacts could be considered suspicious. These items were:

- Tens of thousands of rifles marked with 'USM47A2' designations, stamped with either RED STAR ALLIANCE PROPERTY or EUS PROPERTY. No signs of wartime modifications. All rifles are consistent with each other.",

"- Hundreds of official export documents to various smaller colonial powers that have no record of ever existing in the last thousand years.

- Staff records of people with no connections to any possible descendants.

- News clippings and other local digital media that heavily imply the lack of a modern 5.45x39mm cartridge, despite not being the case."
