"There are... discrepancies. There are differences in the notes we have taken a year ago to the sources we know now. Of this matter is the USCM-Floran War around half a century ago. The war was said to have been fought by the Megacorporate Universal Space Corporate Military in the early 2500s, however, all modern sources state that it was the United States Colonial Marines who fought the Florans in the early 2400s. The United States, not the United Systems. The United States of America.",



"Make no mistake, this is no galactic correction or revisionism. Returning to older sources dating back to the time specifically mention the United States, and absolutely no sign of any megacorporate private military entity ever existing at the time despite directly contradicting the second-hand information written by both my colleagues and I.",




"While none of us are blind to the fact that corporations hold a lot of power and could theoretically begin a hundred-years historical revisionism program, we very much doubt the USCM held that much power. Some speculate that the Colonial Marines converted to the Corporate Entity, but that's the issue: it's just speculation. No tangible evidence exists for this. The Colonial Marines supposedly existed from 2200 to 2500. The Corporate Entity has only existed for the last decade."
