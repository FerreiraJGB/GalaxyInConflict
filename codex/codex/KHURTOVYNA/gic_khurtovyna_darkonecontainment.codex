"Alright, some of you guys already know the drill but for some of you new operators on the block I want you to pay close attention.

The 'Recall' Procedure for the entity some folk have been calling 'The Dark One' is a simple but critical emergency procedure that's only done if for whatever reason it is let out of containment.",



"The containment cube or whatever you want to call it is a magnetically-charged cell powered by the same stuff we've been finding deep underground: 'Black Rock', as the eggheads creatively call it. It's what keeps the damned thing inside and from killing us all. He goes through walls and picks off one guy at a time. Cruel thing. The procedure is largely automated, but if the entity is outside of its cell, you engage the recall procedure.",

"For whatever reason, if we play a recording of a guy screaming on the intercom, that stupid thing comes running back to its cell as if somebody was there. It's disturbing, but that thing seems to have a fondness for the screams of the dying. The Recall Procedure after he's put back inside will activate the magnetic fields and keep him trapped in there.",


"[A smaller recorder is taped to the back]

Yes, we used real people. The Recall Procedure uses a Femur Breaker device, which yes, is exactly what it sounds like. A prisoner is strapped-down onto the device inside the Containment Cell and when the procedure is initiated... The pain and agony is enough to be heard through the cell itself, but we have to play it across the loudspeakers to... attract him.",


"I do not know why this works, but the truth is that there MUST be a human in that device, screaming and begging. Other methods were tried first, but the Femur Breaker's immense pain yield was the only effective solution. Only then does the Dark One appear inside the cell of its own volition. I do not know if he is animalistic or toying with us, but that is the only known way to contain him.",


"I have seen the People's Party do cruel things out of malice, but this is different. This is necessary."
