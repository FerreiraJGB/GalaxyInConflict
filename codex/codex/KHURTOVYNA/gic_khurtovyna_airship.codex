"It's been two weeks.

Two weeks ago I sent Alexei & his men to capture that airship. And for two weeks that airship has continued to wander the skies aimlessly whilst occasionally blaring that infernal siren.

Nobody has been seen in any of the gondolas, which only means one thing. They are dead. All of them. Something inside that machine killed my men. And it's all my fault.",

"My fault for sending them into that ship. My fault for not being there to die with them. And my fault for even becoming so... attached.

Alexei was a good man. One of the best soldiers & best Party members I had the pleasure of knowing. But as a commissar I should know better. Good men will always die in war.",

"If it wasn't the airship it could have been a bullet, or a shell, even the ice cold temperatures. But how does 30 men just disappear? What was inside the machine this entire time?

And who or what is using its siren? These thoughts will never escape my mind for as long as I have left to live. I just want answers damnit."
