DESK OF MAJOR GENERAL IOANN ASLANOV

Dear Mrs. Kowalski, it is with great regret that I must inform you that your husband, Private Third Class Alik Kowalski, was killed in combat.
During a sudden attack by the enemy, a grenade was thrown into his trench. In order to save his fellow soldiers, Kowalski went above & beyond the call of duty and dove onto the live grenade to shield them from the blast.",


"His selfless sacrifice had saved the lives of at least six other men.
I understand that no words of mine can cure you of any grief. The loss of a husband and father to your two growing children is beyond painful. 
I will personally see to it that your family is compensated, and that your husband's sacrifice is remembered. God Bless. - MAJOR GENERAL IOANN ASLANOV"
