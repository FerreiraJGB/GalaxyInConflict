"[EXCERPT FROM THE FIRST FEW PAGES]
Congratulations on your induction into the esteemed Empath Discovery Program! Your remarkable skillset within your civilian life has led us to bringing you into our secretive research facilities, opening up new opportunities for you and your family relatives. You will be automatically assigned a role after a rudimentary interview with one of our supervisors, and benefits will be applied immediately afterwards.",

"Depending on your role, you may be assigned a myriad of tasks, some of which may admittedly not be as exciting as the conspiracy theories may have led you to believe. However, all of our roles are as equally important, as every one of us is a chain in a link. A failing link means a failing whole. Your role could be anywhere from an administrative clerk to a field researcher. As part of our equality doctrine, you may also be asked to undergo basic firearms training.",

"Please do keep in mind that direct contact with your family is strictly prohibited due to the sensitive nature of research performed here. Letters are permitted, but these must be proofread by the Department of Relations staff before being sent out. We thank you for your understanding and hope that you settle in comfortably at our facilities. Further information can be found within this booklet. If you have any questions not found in the booklet, ask a supervisor."
