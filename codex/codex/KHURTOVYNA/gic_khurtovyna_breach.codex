"There was an explosion at the prison complex! Right as the clock hit midnight a portion of the underground facility just fucking exploded! Just hours before we were to kickstart the revolution! Now the Fed is on our ass again! This is terrible news. We've been trying to keep that damn facility under wraps for years. The Fed has had no idea about the complex & what we were doing down there, and we needed it to stay that way.",

"But this explosion is gonna fuck everything up. They're going to go investigate & find out we have been conducting research for at least the last two decades! And when they find that, we're finished. All our hard work gone again, but this time for good and with most of us going to prison! Then it won't be long untill they discover our plan to try and overthrow the Fed again. When they find that out allong with all this, we will all almost certainly get the chair.",

"Twice we were close to accomplishing our goals, only to be stopped at the last minute. Perhaps some of us could go into hiding or maybe get lighter sentences if we come forward? Who knows. But what is clear is that this is the end of the Party, for good this time."
