"A note is attached to the book:

We found this in one of our frontline trenches around a few days ago. We didn't think it might be of any importance considering the clearly panicked and rushed writing of the individual, but it might be useful for public relations if we want to help show the Reds as crazed lunatics.",
 
 

"Date: [Scribbled out]
That fucking corpse! The boys body! Its still staring at me! The blizzard has covered most of him in snow but has conveniently left his fucking eyes untouched! Even in heavy fog, I still see them! And I swear, its even getting closer! Moving forward little by little every damn night! This isn't even possible! I haven't said a word to my comrades about this. Been keeping an ear out for any mention of this.",

"If I wasn't the only one seeing this... it would make me feel better. But no. I haven't heard shit from anyone about fucking corpses. Nobody has even fucking acknowledged its existance! I'm truly alone in this. I'm the only one who can see... him. I know its him. Haunting me. Torturing me. I can't even sleep. I dream about him crawling his way into our trench and killing me. Putting his frozen hand over my mouth as he stares blankly into my eyes!",

"And then I wake up. Restless. Cold. Gasping for air. I just want it to stop! Hes angry that I didn't try to rescue him, but I had no choice god damnit!! I've been in this frozen hell for four years!! I CANT die now!! I wanna see my family again!! If I went out there I would have been on the snow just like you!! So leave me the fuck alone!!",



"I know what he wants. I finally get it. After a month of his torment I finally know what he wants. I need... I MUST bring him back!! I will get him! Tonight, when it gets really dark I'll crawl my way to him & drag him back here! Then I'll be forgiven! And it will all stop! No more nightmares, no more whispers, no more of anything! He'll go home and I can keep fighting this stupid war! Then I'll be home eventually! Everything will be set right!",


"Its time. I can toss these stupid notes into a fire when I get back. If anyone finds these I'd almost certainly get committed, which is no better than dying after four years of war. 

I'm coming to get you."
