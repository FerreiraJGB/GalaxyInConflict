"I don't know who I'm leaving this for. Maybe someone will listen to this, and learn the truth of this place. This facility was designed for the Empath Discovery Program. Nearly all of us thought it was just some fancy name for researching new technologies, but as it turned out, we were just experimenting on humans and forcing them under extreme emotional strain, using some sort of extradimensional rock as a catalyst. The result were empaths, of varying kinds.",

"The ''empaths'' as they're called are named that since they're birthed from, as said, the sheer psychological pressure of a host. Notably, there are records of ''gifted'' individuals with latent psychic powers. These individuals of who are completely undeserving of the death sentence provided by our government, have a much lower resistance to an empath-type reaction. They're like... vectors. We have since contained and documented at least 10 different creatures.",

"A mass-breach occurred... some time ago. I haven't been able to keep track of time, but some sort of ''psychic scream'' caused a spontaneous burst of empath aggression and facility-wide system failures. Typical, I guess. Seen it all the time in movies and games. Just, you know, never thought I'd be on the end of one. I can't find a way back to the surface, but I can still access the local terminals. Every terminal I've come across says the surface is... -100 Celsius. Negative.",

"An entity breached containment by an unknown means. They are simply called a ''Dark One''. He is lethal, to say the least. Able to phase through walls and appear almost anywhere on a whim. I've avoided his touch twelve times by now, but it's clear that I'm a sort of marked man, and I'll fall to him eventually. He was already contained before the breach, but I know it in my gut that there was no way for him to have escaped even during the mass-breach.",

"Someone must've let him out. Someone... Maybe it's not even a ''He'', but multiple. I can't be certain... *wet gurgling noise, followed by distorted laughter* Uh oh, time to go. Hearvocal off."
