"Listen to me! If you want to survive in this place, you've first got to understand that it doesn't matter how strong or healthy you think you are, you're not any better than someone who's sick or disabled. The creatures here feed off your soul. No amount of ''vigor'' is going to increase your odds, they'll just hit harder to compensate. Shed weight, and move fast. Again, the creatures kill at the same speed regardless of if you're ''healthy'' or ''frail''."
