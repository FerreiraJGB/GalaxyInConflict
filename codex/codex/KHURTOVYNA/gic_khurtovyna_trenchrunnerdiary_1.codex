"A note is attached on the book:

We confiscated the personal belongings of [REDACTED]. If he were still alive, he would surely have been disciplined by now, but the contents of what we know here are a little concerning. If the effects of the facility extend beyond its borders, we could be expecting lower troop effectiveness. Recommend sending our special forces to investigate [REDACTED].",
 
"FAILED ASSAULT Date: [Scribbled out]
Last night our commissar ordered an attack on the forward enemy trench. We've been trying to probe their defences for at least a week now, but as typical of the republic, this trench is stupidly fortified! So much concrete it would make an ancient soviet or a fascist blush. We couldn't find any clear weaknesses in their position. Many machine guns, some bunkers, and even what looked like auto cannons!",

"Enough firepower to wipe out a hundred men in an instant! But our commissars & officers felt otherwise, thinking a large sudden attack could catch them off guard & even have them running into the blizzard so we can pick them off. Well, they couldn't have been more wrong. Almost as soon as we left the safety of our trenches, the entire field was filled with bullets & the trench lit up like fireworks! Those in the front were cut down in mere seconds.",

"Me & my comrades quickly dove back into our trench to escape the barrage, but some of our comrades were not so lucky. Many trying to crawl back inside while bullets wailed & impaled them from behind, making sure they didn't come back. One, a young fresh conscript from Nosko station, was close to getting back in. I wanted to get back out & try to save him, but I knew that would ultimately kill me as well. The boy was struck moments later like all the rest.",

"Life soon drained from his eyes, turning them into glass. If only his sacrifice could have gone to something greater than a single trench.",
 
 
 
"BODY IN THE SNOW Date: [Scribbled out]
Last week I made a personal note about our failed night time attack on the enemy trench. And in that note I mentioned the boy from Nosko station who was killed during said attack. His body is right in front of my post. And his empty eyes are staring right at me! When looking over the horizon at the enemy positions, I can see them. Looking at me. Watching me every second.",

"There's no ignoring it either. No matter what I can see them. Sometimes... I even stare right back at them. Right back into those cold hollow eyes as if I'm trying to appease or acknowledge what they are doing! Its making me feel sick. Hopefully when the blizzard gets stronger it will blanket him in snow."
