"I had a horrible dream last week. A dark shadow emerged out of a hole within my cell floor. It smelled foul. It looked right at me & began to float towards me. I felt like screaming but I just couldn't. Wasn't able to move either. Then he touched me and I felt a horrible pain in my head & wanted to vomit. The thing started laughing at me. Amused by my suffering. After what felt like hours I woke up in a cold sweat & out of breath.",

"I tried to just pass it off like it was just another terrible nightmare but I just couldn't shake it out of my head. ''It'' out of my head. Ever since that night, I see it in all my dreams. Even if its not a nightmare I can still see it in the background or corner of my eye. I've started calling it ''The Dark One''. I'm more afraid to fall asleep than I ever was before in my life.",

"This place is nothing but pure evil. I still don't understand what all the doctors are trying to accomplish here. I hope they all go to hell & rot. Hearvocal off."
