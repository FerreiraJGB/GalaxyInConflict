"We have managed to keep the feds away from the complex for the time being. After our own investigation into the explosion we quickly noticed that the explosion came from within the Dark One's containment cell.

And that the Dark One was also free again. Facility infrastructure has been severely damaged all around & many inmates have also perished either to roaming anomalies, the explosion, or the Dark One itself.",

"The worst thing about this though is that our researchers say that the Dark One has become much more powerful than ever realized & that it's currently conjuring a powerful psychic storm around the planet as a whole!

Soon the tempratures will drop to inhospitable levels & no ships or communications will be able to enter or leave the planet. As if this couldn't have possibly gotten worse...",

"So this is it, not just for the Party, but for the planet as a whole. All of us will die soon. And it's all our fault."
