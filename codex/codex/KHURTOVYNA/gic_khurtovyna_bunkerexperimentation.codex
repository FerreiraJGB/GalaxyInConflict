"Hearvocal On.

I have worked for 5 years in this facility. I should've taken the offer to leave when I could. I'm an idiot... Another 4-year term... There's something. It's... It permeates the walls of this facility. It eats into our bodies, our minds... our souls. Our work here doesn't just involve looking at rocks or breaking holes in caves. We. Are. Making. Our. Apocalypse.

Let me explain:",

"When they introduced us to this facility, we were told that we were just in the leading-edge of civil and military research. Things like improved alloys and computer infrastructure. That sort of stuff. But once they start taking a liking to you? Oh-hoh-ho... They start showing you... things! When they named themselves as an Empath Program, they weren't lying. Not be technicality, of course. We all thought it was just some cutesy name.",

"We were experimenting on PEOPLE. Seeing what emotions we could squeeze out of them while jamming them with extradimensional rock. And sometimes? It. Worked. Something not of this reality. Something there, and not there. Tangible, but flickering. We've seen the likes of humanoid aliens like the Florans and Glitch, but this? It was like a SPIRIT. An embodiment of our... thoughts. Why else would they plug into a man's mind?",

"They tell us these men are violent criminals and that they are deserving of the fate they've been given. But I'm not stupid. They are political prisoners sent here by the People's Party. Everyone knows that they make people disappear. It's no fucking secret. They- What was- *distant men shouting* Hearvocal off!"
