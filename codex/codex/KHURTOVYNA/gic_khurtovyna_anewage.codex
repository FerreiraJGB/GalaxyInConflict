"The turn of a new millennium is upon us. An event that only few men throughout history get to witness. But this celebration will be unlike anything humanity has ever seen before. 

In the turn of the last millennium, humanity was still grounded to Earth. Now we have expanded across the galaxy on countless worlds, such as our own.",




"The stars will glow like never before with untold billions crowding their streets, banging their pots & pans, and lighting the skies with millions of fireworks. Yes, there couldn't possibly be a better time for us to act. A new millennium, and a new age for our world. Our time is almost upon us.

Since the disastrous blood march we have learned from our mistakes & gained valuable knowledge. We have most of the common folk on our side, and more than enough weapons should things go as they did 30 years ago.",




"The people are on our side now. There's no stopping us now. We shall march upon the capital again on the 1st and begin this new era of equality & prosperity for all!

Peace, Land, and Bread!"
