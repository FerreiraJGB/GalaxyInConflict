"I've been in this place for months now I think. I wanna leave but they keep telling me it's for my own safety. That I'm dangerous & can hurt people. But all these people ever do is hurt me & the other prisoners. Lately I've been hearing voices in my head though. It's creeping me out. I can't even tell if it's because of what these people are doing to me or if ''something'' is really trying to talk to me. A lot of horrible & strange things happen down here, so nothing is truly out of the question.",
