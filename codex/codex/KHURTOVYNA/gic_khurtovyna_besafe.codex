"To my darling husband

I pray that neither the storms nor the enemy has taken you from us. 
We received your last letter from over a month ago, but as you know it takes so long for letters to make their way from either side.",

"I expect that this one will also take just as long to get to you, so as long as the trains don't get slowed down any more than usual. 
I want you to know that we, more importantly I, haven't forgotten about you. Some other men have tried making advances since your long departure to the front. 
They are all fools. Thinking only of a shallow & temporary ''good time''. My love is for one, and only one man. The man I married three years ago.",

"I dream of the day you step off the train for the last time, so I can have you in my arms once more. 
Until that day comes, I will continue to honor you, our marriage, and care for our two beautiful children. We love you Alik, and miss you dearly with all our hearts. 

Be safe.

Lauren Kowalski"
