"We've been hearing some tall tales from some of our People's Army ''guests'' that there's some ''Ghost Ranger'' thats going around & killing PA troops. All the men who have told this story so far though seem to be experiencing severe cases of shellshock, so their accounts are most likely part of some psychotic delusion. There could very well be some truth to these stories however, as its not too far fetched to say a lone Ranger could have miraculously survived the massacre and continued fighting.",

"Seems that whatever he's doing to the Reds out there is making a fair bunch of them shit themselves daily. Hopefully we can meet & have a chat with this ''Ghost Ranger'' one day.

I sure as hell would love to shake his hand."
