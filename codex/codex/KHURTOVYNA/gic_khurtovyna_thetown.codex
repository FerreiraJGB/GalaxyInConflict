"When stopping by another station today we saw a crowd gathered near the towns coal mine. They were screaming & shouting about the same old shit. How their work hours were unfair & that they deserved at least a whole weekend off or so from work among other things. We approached them like we always do with any angry crowd & told them the same old shit. ''We need you to keep working so that everyone around the Republic has enough coal.''",

"''No work means less coal to be shipped around for everyone.'' ''Less coal means no heating.'' ''And less coal also means the trains will slow down or stop.'' After giving the usual speech that we must have given a thousand times already, the crowd unsurprisingly got upset about their ridiculous demands not being met and started swearing at us. Nothing we hadn't heard before. But then, someone said something we hadn't heard before. ''Fuck the Republic pigs!! We will join the People's Party!!''.", 

"After that, the bastards started chanting bullshit People's Party rhetoric and their motto, showing their true colors. Yeah, that really got us pissed. Our ''people'' siding with the enemy we have to fight every single day so that they can live fairly comfortable lives. We all gave this glancing look to each other. All of us on the same page, including our NCO. Without saying a word, we swiftly pulled our rifles up towards the crowd, and held the trigger.",


"After it was all said & done we just stood there. Felt like we stood on that ground for a million years with nothing but the wind howling and snow blowing into our faces. Then our NCO told us to pack up & get back into the train. And so we did. Not saying a single word till after we were on our way. It's not that any of us felt guilty. Far from. We just couldn't believe nearly an entire town had stooped low enough to give themselves to the Reds.",

"The incident was reported to high command soon after by our NCO. We were expecting some sort of punishment for this, but it never came. Right after our NCO was finished radioing command he went to the large map we had in the train and crossed out the town's name with a marker. And that told us everything we needed to know."
