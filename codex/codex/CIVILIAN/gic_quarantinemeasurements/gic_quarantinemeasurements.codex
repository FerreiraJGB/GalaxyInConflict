"Quarantine Regulations:

All ships that request docking must be scanned as well as have its passengers and cargo scanned before the boarding of a station. Foreign contaminants listed under any Biohazardous descriptor, are punishable by a fine of 4000 credits and upwards.",

"QUARANTINE SCANNING

The relatively quick biological scans are merely to prevent colony or station-wide pandemics. This is considerate, and for the safety of station citizens. Each species is physiologically different and each have their own reactions to bacteria and other hostile, invasive contaminants. Failure to submit to bio-scans is a punishable offense.",

"BIO-LEVEL

Any contaminant that isn't marked under a Biological descriptor is considered non-threatening and such contaminants are typically injected (in small amounts) into the atmosphere and ventilation systems of a colony or station in order to prevent the atrophy of inhabitantsâ€™ immune systems if no other 'safe' contaminants are found. However, actively spreading Bio-level 2 or higher contaminants is punishable by death.",

"PUNISHMENTS

Most instances of biology-related crimes are punishable by death ever since the rapid expansion of the Avian Tu'kurak Parasite. Hundreds of stations were shut down and millions of people died as a recent influx of refugees fleeing Stargazer religious persecution had been infected prior to seeking asylum, due to their native impoverished living conditions.",

"This incident created the Interstellar Biological Termination Treaty signed by most parties of the Galactic Community. This act defines the turning point of the aforementioned pandemic which lasted for 2 galactic-standard years and resulted in approximately 400 million interspecies deaths.",

"Over half of these deaths were from firearms as a crude means of quarantining the infection.

Let this be a lesson on the dangers foreign contaminants pose. Unlike what some may believe, there is no magical forcefield that filters out 'invasive contaminants' that are already inside your body."
