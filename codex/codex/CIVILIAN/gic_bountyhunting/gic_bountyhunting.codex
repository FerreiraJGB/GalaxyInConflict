"Bounty hunting is a lucrative business in low-security and anarchic systems but most criminals, if not all, are smart enough to wander a planet with their ships nearby, often in orbit. This is where space combat becomes an integral part of a civilian's service to the system. Local System Security isn't able to hunt down all ships on their own and sometimes there is too much criminal activity to handle at once.",

"Additionally, pilots in Security forces exist on a volunteer basis only and cannot be consistently trained when utilizing your local Security department's limited resources and staff.",

"Ship bounty hunting works very much in the same way as the assassination of targets on a planet. However, destruction of the criminal's ships is the most viable option. It is desirable to kill the bounty without destroying the ship if possible. The Bounty Hunter is permitted to keep the ship as long as the IFF is disabled and attached to the Hunter's ship.",

"Proof is required in order to claim a bounty. Gun Cameras/Normal Cameras and physical salvage from the vessel is the bare minimum which will only net 10% of the bounty. For the full claim, one must also be in possession of a DNA sample of the criminal as well as the IFF Transponder and cockpit data. Claims may go as high as 1 million credits per kill.",

"Reminder: System traffic is logged. Deviations from standard orbit and unusual Delta-V maneuvers will be observed. Thermal signatures cannot be hidden and Warps are present as high energy fields on the edges of a star system. If you can see the enemy, they can see you just as well."
