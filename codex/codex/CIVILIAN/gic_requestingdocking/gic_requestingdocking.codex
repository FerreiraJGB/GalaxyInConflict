"While docking protocols vary between species, human docking protocols strictly operate off protocols that reduce confusion between traffic control and pilots throughout human-space. The rest of this book will explain the standardized protocols of traffic control for pilots.",

"ESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS

Establish communications with traffic control and request a docking on channel. Identify your Ship ID and actively state your intent to dock. Note that you must be within 10000 metres from the colony or station for docking requests to be accepted. Depending on your ship's priority it may take anywhere from 5 minutes to multiple hours in busier colonies or stations.",

"QUEUE TRAFFIC

Once assigned a docking bay by Traffic Control, proceed to your assigned docking pad and make way for larger or higher priority vessels (displayed on your cockpit scanner). Ensure to regulate speed to 100 km/h or less and deploy Docking Locks if docking or Magnetic Landing Gears if landing on a landing pad. Once docked, follow ground crew protocol and refer to the uploaded manuals and other issued information from the space port's data-net."
