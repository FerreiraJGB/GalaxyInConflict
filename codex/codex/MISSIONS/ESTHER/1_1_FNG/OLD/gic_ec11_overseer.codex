"I can't believe they still make these. Too tough for the real deal but they sure do have aesthetic. Uhm yeah, this is Remuli Eres of the 6th Gazring Recruit Corps. Here before the breakout. Never got past basic thanks to the whole drone invasion deal. If you find this, I'm probably dead. You're probably asking what I'm doing and when this takes place. Yeah this recording takes place after the retreat from this side of the Gazring. They're all going to Ring Arm Hub One.",

"Well, we've fought so long but they simply just have more drones than we do ammunition. We're the last holdouts of the place. They can't force us to retreat, they're just as pathetic as we are for living. Last batches of 12.7mm ammunition oughtta hold them off for a few more Earthern weeks, but can't really guarantee that either. They start firing those pin things and they give you just enough time to realise you've been targetted. Cruel bastards.",

"I wouldn't know any specific positions. They've overrun the whole place. Sure we might shoot down a couple flyers here and there, some swarm drone groups but those Protectorate robots play dirty. They like to hide in the vents. This habitat is the only place where they can't hide, but then they just switch it up and suddenly they have the armor and numbers to push us back. Yeah we've sealed our fate. Atleast I get to die on some real grass, even if it isn't a planet."
