  "description" : "A portrait painting reminiscent of 19th century human artwork, though a closer inspection reveals brushstrokes which are slightly too uniform for a human hand. It depicts a well dressed Glitch whose face is covered in the dings and scratches which are typical of an experienced duelist. Seemingly the work of a skilled artist, it may fetch a good price if you can find someone who's interested.
