  "description" : "Large seafaring vessels are a rare sight among most Glitch societies, but the Free-Thinkers seem to be well versed in their engineering. The one depicted in this painting appears to be outfitted for hunting massive sea creatures. Who knows what manner of alien leviathans may have graced its deck? Nautical artwork never goes out of fashion, so it shouldn't be too hard to find a buyer if you wish to part with it.
