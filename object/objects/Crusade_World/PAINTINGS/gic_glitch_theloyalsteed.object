  "description" : "''A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!'' A highly durable and brutally efficient robotic horse such as the one depicted in this painting could certainly be worth a kingdom to some societies. Among the Glitch though, they are a common sight. The painting is anything but common, however, and could be quite valuable if you can find the right buyer.
